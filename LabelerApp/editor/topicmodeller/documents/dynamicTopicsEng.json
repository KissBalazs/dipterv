More\naccurately, Password Checker Online checks the password strength against two\nbasic types of\npassword cracking\nmethods \u2013 the brute-force attack and the dictionary attack. It also analyzes\nthe syntax of your password and informs you about its possible weaknesses.\nThis tool can thus also help you create stronger password from a weak one. Using Password Checker Online is safe in both the syntax analyzing\nmode and the dictionary attack mode. When you type your password to the\nPassword field its syntax is analyzed on the client side, by\nJavaScript in your browser \u2013 i.e. the password is not transferred over the\nnetwork to our server. You can also have your password checked against the\ndictionary attack. In this case the password is sent to our server in an\nencrypted form so you do not need to worry about attackers sniffing on your\nnetwork. However, the implementation is not safe against\nman-in-the-middle attacks.\nThe score computation is mostly based on the time that a middle size botnet\nwould need in order to crack your password if it employs the brute-force\nattack. An attacker typically tries several most common passwords first\ntherefore if your password belongs to the list of 10000 most common\npasswords your password receives score 0 because these passwords are\nextremely weak. There are important attributes of your password that an automatic tool such\nas Password Checker Online can not evaluate. When you create your password you\nshould keep in your mind that it should not contain any information that is\nrelated to you or the system in which the password is used. You should also\navoid using same or similar passwords in different systems \u2013 e.g. you should\nuse completely different passwords for your social network account and for\nyour email account. Usage # Simply enter the password you want to check into the Password\nfield and that is it! The password is being analyzed as you are\ntyping it, so you see the results of the syntax analysis immediately.\nIf you want to check your password against the dictionary attack click the\n\"Check!\" button in the dictionary attack section. Be patient, the dictionary\nattack check may take a few seconds to complete.

Do not use the same password, security question and answer for multiple important accounts. 2. Use a password that has at least 16 characters, use at least one number, one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter and one special symbol. 3. Do not use the names of your families, friends or pets in your passwords. 4. Do not use postcodes, house numbers, phone numbers, birthdates, ID card numbers, social security numbers, and so on in your passwords. 5. Do not use any dictionary word in your passwords. 6. Do not use two or more similar passwords which most of their characters are same, for example, ilovefreshflowersMac, ilovefreshflowersDropBox, since if one of these passwords is stolen, then it means that all of these passwords are stolen. 7. Do not use something that can be cloned( but you can't change ) as your passwords, such as your fingerprints. 8. Do not let your Web browsers( FireFox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, IE ) store your passwords, since all passwords saved in Web browsers can be revealed easily. 9. Do not log in to important accounts on the computers of others, or when connected to a public Wi-Fi hotspot, Tor, free VPN or web proxy. 10. Do not send sensitive information online via unencrypted( e.g. HTTP or FTP ) connections, because messages in these connections can be sniffed with very little effort. You should use encrypted connections such as HTTPS, SFTP, FTPS, SMTPS, IPSec whenever possible. 11. When travelling, you can encrypt your Internet connections before they leave your laptop, tablet, mobile phone or router. For example, you can set up a private VPN( with MS-CHAP v2 or stronger protocols ) on your own server( home computer, dedicated server or VPS ) and connect to it. Alternatively, you can set up an encrypted SSH tunnel between your router and your home computer( or a remote server of your own ) with PuTTY and connect your programs( e.g. FireFox ) to PuTTY. Then even if somebody captures your data as it is transmitted between your device( e.g. laptop, iPhone, iPad ) and your server with a packet sniffer, they'll won't be able to steal your data and passwords from the encrypted streaming data. 12. How secure is my password? Perhaps you believe that your passwords are very strong, difficult to hack. But if a hacker has stolen your username and the MD5 hash value of your password from a company's server, and the rainbow table of the hacker contains this MD5 hash, then your password will be cracked quickly. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To check the strength of your passwords and know whether they're inside the popular rainbow tables, you can convert your passwords to MD5 hashes on a MD5 hash generator, then decrypt your passwords by submitting these hashes to an online MD5 decryption service. For instance, your password is \"0123456789A\", using the brute-force method, it may take a computer almost one year to crack your password, but if you decrypt it by submitting its MD5 hash( C8E7279CD035B23BB9C0F1F954DFF5B3 ) to a MD5 decryption website, how long will it take to crack it? You can perform the test yourself. 13. It's recommended to change your passwords every 10 weeks. 14. It's recommended that you remember a few master passwords, store other passwords in a plain text file and encrypt this file with 7-Zip, GPG or a disk encryption software such as BitLocker, or manage your passwords with a password management software. 15. Encrypt and backup your passwords to different locations, then if you lost access to your computer or account, you can retrieve your passwords back quickly. 16. Turn on 2-step authentication whenever possible. 17. Do not store your critical passwords in the cloud. 18. Access important websites( e.g. Paypal ) from bookmarks directly, otherwise please check its domain name carefully, it's a good idea to check the popularity of a website with Alexa toolbar to ensure that it's not a phishing site before entering your password. 19. Protect your computer with firewall and antivirus software, block all incoming connections and all unnecessary outgoing connections with the firewall. Download software from reputable sites only, and verify the MD5 / SHA1 / SHA256 checksum or GPG signature of the installation package whenever possible. 20. Keep the operating systems( e.g. Windows 7, Windows 10, Mac OS X, iOS, Linux ) and Web browsers( e.g. FireFox, Chrome, IE, Microsoft Edge ) of your devices( e.g. Windows PC, Mac PC, iPhone, iPad, Android tablet ) up-to-date by installing the latest security update. 21. If there are important files on your computer, and it can be accessed by others, check if there are hardware keyloggers( e.g. wireless keyboard sniffer ), software keyloggers and hidden cameras when you feel it's necessary. 22. If there are WIFI routers in your home, then it's possible to know the passwords you typed( in your neighbor's house ) by detecting the gestures of your fingers and hands, since the WIFI signal they received will change when you move your fingers and hands. You can use an on-screen keyboard to type your passwords in such cases, it would be more secure if this virtual keyboard( or soft keyboard ) changes layouts every time. 23. Lock your computer and mobile phone when you leave them.\n24. Encrypt the entire hard drive with LUKS or similar tools before putting important files on it, and destroy the hard drive of your old devices physically if it's necessary. 25. Access important websites in private or incognito mode, or use one Web browser to access important websites, use another one to access other sites. Or access unimportant websites and install new software inside a virtual machine created with VMware, VirtualBox or Parallels. 26. Use at least 3 different email addresses, use the first one to receive emails from important sites and Apps, such as Paypal and Amazon, use the second one to receive emails from unimportant sites and Apps, use the third one( from a different email provider, such as Outlook and GMail ) to receive your password-reset email when the first one( e.g. Yahoo Mail ) is hacked. 27. Use at least 2 differnet phone numbers, do NOT tell others the phone number which you use to receive text messages of the verification codes. 28. Do not click the link in an email or SMS message, do not reset your passwords by clicking them, except that you know these messages are not fake. 29. Do not tell your passwords to anybody in the email. 30. It's possible that one of the software or App you downloaded or updated has been modified by hackers, you can avoid this problem by not installing this software or App at the first time, except that it's published to fix security holes. You can use Web based apps instead, which are more secure and portable. 31. Be careful when using online paste tools and screen capture tools, do not let them to upload your passwords to the cloud. 32. If you're a webmaster, do not store the users passwords, security questions and answers as plain text in the database, you should store the salted ( SHA1, SHA256 or SHA512 )hash values of of these strings instead.\nIt's recommended to generate a unique random salt string for each user. In addition, it's a good idea to log the user's device information( e.g. OS version, screen resolution, etc. ) and save the salted hash values of them, then when he/she try to login with the correct password but his/her device information does NOT match the previous saved one, let this user to verify his/her identity by entering another verification code sent via SMS or email.\n33. If you are a software developer, you should publish the update package signed with a private key using GnuPG, and verify the signature of it with the public key published previously.\n34. To keep your online business safe, you should register a domain name of your own, and set up an email account with this domain name, then you'll not lose your email account and all your contacts, since your can host your mail server anywhere, your email account can't be disabled by the email provider.\n35. If an online shopping site only allows to make payment with credit cards, then you should use a virtual credit card instead.\n36. Close your web browser when you leave your computer, otherwise the cookies can be intercepted with a small USB device easily, making it possible to bypass two-step verification and log into your account with stolen cookies on other computers.\n37. Distrust and remove bad SSL certificates from your Web browser, otherwise you will NOT be able to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the HTTPS connections which use these certificates.\nProxy\nThis online app is designed for: \uc554\ud638 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uae30, generador de contrase\u00f1as, generar contrase\u00f1a, passwort generator, generateur mot de passe, g\u00e9n\u00e9rateur de mot de passe, generateur de mot de passe, g\u00e9n\u00e9rateur mot de passe, gerador de senha, gerador de senhas, \u30d1\u30b9\u30ef\u30fc\u30c9\u751f\u6210, \u30d1\u30b9\u30ef\u30fc\u30c9\u4f5c\u6210, \u30d1\u30b9\u30ef\u30fc\u30c9 \u81ea\u52d5\u751f\u6210, \u30d1\u30b9\u30ef\u30fc\u30c9 \u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u30e0\nCopyright \u00a9 2012 - 2017 PasswordsGenerator.net.

Random Password Generator\nPatterns MD5 SHA1 Guid Base64\nPassword - is a string of chars used for profile authentication to prove identity or access approval to gain access to a resource (computer, software, website), which should be kept secret from those not allowed access. Password strength (check & meter) is a measure of the effectiveness of a password in resisting guessing and bruteforce attacks. In its usual form, it estimates how many trials an attacker who does not have direct access to the password would need, on average, to guess it correctly. The strength of a password is a function of length, complexity, and unpredictability. Using strong passwords lowers overall risk of a security breach.\nAbout Password and information security:\nAn inexperienced internet user is godsend for a hacker. Internet is not only about chatting or doing shopping online. There are banking services, account operations, financial affairs etc. The more information is online the more computer security is needed. There are lots of ways how one can protect own information. Password is one of them. Password provides the security of the account created by the user. Password is used to login and confirm the identity of the user. The main password mission is to protect your personal information thus it must be created with the great thoroughness. The encrypted connection by HTTPS protocol is one of the means one can use to protect the password and login working online. To check if the internet resource is secure you can refer to address bar, as a rule if it is under protection there is a lock sign (it depends on the type of the browser). This check helps you make sure it is not a phishing site. More than in half of the cases users don't usually check whether there is a lock sign or not. But dealing with financial issues people tend to be more vigilant. In general we may say that users don't pay much attention to the security of internet site. It is obvious that the internet users are recommended to create unique passwords for significant and major services. The main way of the account theft is by hacking the off-site resources. The major internet services are constantly working increasing the level of security but less significant chats, torrent trackers, online shops disregard it and they can be hacked easily. Logging into a site with low level of security using the same password as you have for e-mails you are jeopardizing your mail. If the site is hacked the cyberpunk will get the access to your privacy. Due to the modern security standards the secure and safe passwords is a combination of eight symbols: letters in different cases, numbers and signs that are chosen in random order or in order that is clear only for the user. Nowadays millions of users face the problem of internet fraud every day. Internet fraud is the theft of the password and spamming using your e-mail address, social networking sites or even financial frauds. Many experts claim that the internet users suffer from their own carelessness and nonchalance, bringing the efforts of internet companies to create a high security level to naught. Internet security and protection of your privacy is very important and vital issue. What is internet security? This is the process of providing user's confidentiality and privacy, data integrity and information availability. The confidentiality is when the access is allowed only for authenticated users. Data integrity is the credibility of information and the methods of data processing. Availability is the provision of the access only for authorized users. If you are not concerned with your internet security you are wrong. Even though you are not an active user, your social networking accounts can be hacked in order to extort money from your friends or you can find your bank accounts in danger.\nRules and tips for creating strong and secure passwords:\nUse this generator. Is at least eight (or > 8) characters long. Does not contain your real name, user name, address, or company name. Avoid character repetition, keyboard patterns, dictionary words, letter or number sequences (1234, abc etc.), usernames, relative or pet names and biographical information (e.g., ID numbers or birth dates). Avoid using the same password twice for multiple profiles & accounts.\nAvoid using information that is or might become publicly associated with the user or the account (date of birth, mother's maiden name). Include uppercase and lowercase alphabetic chars, numbers. One or more special symbols if permitted. Generate passwords randomly where feasible. Is significantly different from previous passwords. Do not use passwords which consist wholly of any simple combination of the aforementioned weak components.\nMore rules and tips for strong and secure random password generator.\nRandom list\nNumeric

I wanted the recipe to be simple, the bread to be soft, and the crust to be golden and chewy. The task seemed easy enough, but as time has proven again and again, the kitchen staples are the most difficult to get just right.\u00a0I have worked on this task passively since I began developing my own recipes years ago. There were many good loaves along the way, but never a loaf that made me stop in my tracks and proclaim, \"This is the one!\" Well, that is, until now. This basic sandwich loaf meets all of my requirements. The recipe is simple, only requiring 20 minutes or so of active preparation. The interior is light and soft, with sunflower seeds added for variation in taste and texture. The exterior is brushed with an egg wash to brown the loaf and give the golden crust a chewy texture. The egg wash also helps seeds or oats stick to the top so it can be adorned however you please.\u00a0I haven't played around yet with substitutions (such as multi-grain or whole wheat), but when I find another recipe I will certainly share.\u00a0I've had more than my fair share of bread over the years, but this loaf truly stands out as something special.\nMy boyfriend starts every morning with two slices of peanut butter toast. Over the last five years, we have gone through several toasters together. The first, a relatively cheap toaster, lasted for a couple years before the coils burnt out. The second, a much more expensive toaster, brought hopes that it would hold up over time. It did hold up, but it performed dreadfully at its single purpose. With a shade scale from 1 to 5, it blackened toast at level 2 and set off the smoke detectors at level 3. My boyfriend actually taped down the shade scale knob because the toaster never seemed to toast consistently at the same level, believing I must have been messing with it (I wasn't).When Wolf Gourmet\u00a0asked me to test their Four Slice Toaster, I was excited to see how it would perform against my past experience. The toaster fits larger than average slices and self-centers the bread while toasting to ensure even browning. It works equally well with store bought sandwich loaves as it does with artisan breads. The toaster also has special settings for frozen bread or waffles so they defrost and toast to your desired level in one easy step.\u00a0My favorite feature on the toaster is the \"Keep Warm\" button, which toasts the bread and keeps it warm for up to three minutes thereafter. When I am rushing around the kitchen preparing other ingredients, it is a definite perk to have the toast ready whenever I am (especially when spreading butter or peanut butter to the ideal melting consistency). Albeit minor, my only complaint is that it may take more than one cycle to reach a dark toasted brown when toasting extra thick slices of bread. Overall, the toaster reached my expectations in its single purpose\u2014making a perfect piece of toast.\nUltimately, high quality construction and performance make a difference when it comes to toasters. Wolf Gourmet is generously giving away one four slice toaster to a Pastry Affair reader. To enter the giveaway,Leave a comment below and share\u00a0your favorite way to enjoy homemade bread (we can all use more delicious ideas!).Privately include your email address on the form when posting your comment so I can reach you. The giveaway is open to anyone 18 years of age or older with a valid U.S. shipping address (no P.O. boxes, please).The contest will end on Sunday, April 30th at 11:59 pm (CST). The winner will be chosen randomly and have 24 hours to respond and confirm their shipping address, or a new winner will be selected.\nThis Basic Sandwich Loaf is a kitchen staple. The bread is subtly sweetened with honey and uses olive oil to retain a soft crumb. Sliced thin for sandwiches or thick for toast, the bread holds up well in variety of situations. I prefer mixing in a few raw sunflower seeds for flavor and texture, but you could do as you choose with your loaves. For best results, use a new package or container of active dry yeast.One Year Ago:\u00a0Hazelnut Cherry Granola with Chocolate Coconut Bites Two Years Ago:\u00a0Cherry Almond Granola and Cinnamon Sugar Swirl Loaf Three Years Ago:\u00a0Honey Almond Quinoa Granola & Coconut Tapioca PuddingFour Years Ago:\u00a0\u00a0Raspberry Lemon Cupcakes, Pita Bread, Almond Joy Candy Bars, & Mango LassiFive Years Ago:\u00a0Blackberry Goat Cheese Tart, Chocolate Whoopie Pies, Hot Cross Buns, & Irene's Orange RollsSix Years Ago:\u00a0Honey Rolls, Chocolate Nests,\u00a0& Roasted PineappleBasic Sandwich BreadYields 1 loafDough2 teaspoons active dry yeast1 cup (235 ml) barely warm milk1/3 cup (80 ml) barely warm water2 tablespoons honey2 tablespoons olive oil1 teaspoon salt3 1/2 cups (445 grams) bread flour1/4 cup ( grams) raw sunflower seeds (optional)ToppingEgg wash (1 large egg + 1 tablespoon water, whisked)Raw sunflower seeds (optional)Old fashioned oats (optional)In a large mixing bowl (or bowl of a stand mixer), sprinkle the yeast over the barely warm milk and water. Stir in the honey, olive oil, and salt. Gradually add bread flour and sunflower seeds, mixing until the dough comes together. If the dough is too dry and will not come together, add small amounts of water until it does. Conversely, if the dough is too sticky, add flour until it becomes workable; however, do not add too much flour or the bread will become dense.Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead the dough for 7-10 minutes, or until elastic. Alternatively, using the dough hook on a stand mixer, knead the dough for 7-10 minutes, or until elastic. Cover dough with plastic wrap or a kitchen towel and let rise until doubled in a warm place, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Punch down the dough before turning out onto a lightly floured surface. Shape the dough into an even log and place in a lightly greased 9 x 5-inch loaf pan. Press dough down so it reaches the corners evenly. Cover with a kitchen towel and let rise for another 40-50 minutes until doubled.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C).Brush the top of the loaf with egg wash. Sprinkle with sunflower seeds and oats, if desired. Bake for 40-50 minutes, or until bread is golden and sounds hollow when tapped (internal temperature of 190 degrees F). Remove from baking pan and allow to cool before slicing and serving.Disclosure: A complimentary four slice toaster was provided for review by Wolf Gourmet.

The long daylight hours and warmth of the sun bring promise of summer, but the chill of the mornings are still reminiscent of winter. The bare branches are beginning, ever so slowly, to gain color.\u00a0In my personal life, it is also a time of transition. After an exhausting search for a house\u00a0involving multiple offers and multiple disappointments, an offer was accepted on my dream house. I am still nervous, fearful that somehow even now it will all be too good to be true. There are still compromises,\u00a0as I knew there would be (mainly being in proximity to a busy, noisy road), but the rest is more beautiful than I dared to imagine.As the reality of a huge purchase is settling in, I am trying to shake off the anxious energy building within me. The closing date is two months away, so I'm spending my time designing the new space instead of worrying about the decision. The move from an apartment to a home will be an enormous shift in a dozen different ways, but I couldn't be more excited about the change.\nOver the last couple months, the overwhelming stress of the house search made it difficult to take proper care of everything else. Dishes sat on the counter, clothes piled up on the floor, and other responsibilities were set aside as all free time was devoted to looking at houses.\u00a0Making meals in large quantities was one choice that helped ease the stress. One of the best breakfast decisions was making a large batch of baked oatmeal on the weekends.During the spring months, when the weather is still unpredictable, I find that a big bowl of hot cereal satisfies the hunger as well as the soul. Oatmeal has a warmth and heartiness that starts a day off right. With this baked version, I used frozen blueberries for convenience. The oatmeal comes together quickly and leftovers can be easily reheated to enjoy during the rest of the week.\nBlueberry Banana Baked Oatmeal is a hearty breakfast that is enjoyed hot from the oven. Cinnamon spiced oats are layered with sliced bananas, toasted almonds, and blueberries. The oats are lightly sweetened with maple syrup; additional syrup can be added to each serving to find the ideal level of sweetness. The baked oatmeal reheats well, which makes it ideal for a quick breakfast on weekday mornings.One Year Ago:\u00a0Bananas Foster Sauce\u00a0Two Years Ago:\u00a0Banana Chocolate Hazelnut Cupcakes\u00a0Three Years Ago:\u00a0Orange Coconut Pull-Apart Bread & Coconut MacaroonsFour Years Ago:\u00a0\u00a0Chocolate Oatmeal Raisin Cookies, Coconut Whipped Cream, Chocolate Ginger Biscotti, &\u00a0Banana Cinnamon PancakesFive Years Ago:\u00a0Chocolate Caramel Crispy Bars, Tropical Banana Bread, Strawberry Balsamic Jam, & Strawberry Honey Oatmeal BarsSix Years Ago:\u00a0Banana Pudding, Devil's Food Cake, Flourless PB Cookies, & Orange SconesBlueberry Banana Baked OatmealAdapted from Heidi Swanson's Super Natural Every DayYields 4-6 servings2 cups (160 grams) old fashioned oats1/2 cup (70 grams) almonds, toasted and chopped1 teaspoon baking powder2 teaspoons ground cinnamon1/2 teaspoon salt2 cups (500 mL) whole milk (I used almond milk)1/4 cup (65 mL) pure maple syrup1 large egg1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil2 teaspoons vanilla extract2 ripe bananas, sliced into 1/2-inch pieces1 to 1 1/2 cups (175-225 grams) fresh or frozen blueberriesPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Growing up, I had recurring dreams of houses filled with endless rooms. I would explore them, opening door after door, impatient to see what the next one held, disappointed when I finally awoke. Nowadays, my love for houses reveals itself in less subtle manners. Along with a standing date to watch This Old House on Sunday mornings, I regularly go on home tours for no reason other than a curiosity to know what's inside. In the summer, my boyfriend and I go on long walks around the lakes scattering our Minnesotan city. The lake walks are our compromise; he prefers to take in the beauty of nature and I prefer to take in the beauty of the lakefront properties.\u00a0I imagine the lives held within those four walls\u2014what the mothers hope, what the fathers fear, what the children dream.\nNow that I've recently started the search for a home, the excitement I've kindled has faded somewhat as the reality has sunk in. The market is difficult, the region I'm searching is one of the highest priced in the city, and the houses I can afford will need a lot of love. I understood there would be compromises, but it wasn't until I was actually faced with the tangible decisions that I realized how difficult this process would become. Do I choose the house with the beautiful yard, but disappointingly tiny kitchen? The house with the pleasing fit and finish, but dysfunctional layout? While a good coat of paint can go a long way, it cannot cover up the unchangeable.Right now I am looking for a beautiful place, a beautiful place to grow my family, a beautiful place that needs only a good coat of paint and little else. It doesn't exist\u2014not for me and not right now\u2014which has been a hard realization to swallow. Adjusting my expectations has left me with complicated feelings, especially when reality still comes at such a high price.A house doesn't make a home, as my mother reminds me. And she's right, of course. It will be up to me to make a place beautiful, to put in the love and the work and the hope, to build a home.\nOatmeal Fudge Bars are a sweet, chewy bar to satisfy your cookie cravings. The bars feature rich dark chocolate sandwiched between chewy oatmeal cookie layers. The cookie layers are more pronounced than the chocolate, creating a balance between flavors.

For instance, if you think you\u2019ve invented something\nreally cool, you can freely search patent ideas online and find out if your product is patentable or if someone else had your really cool idea first. Some things\nthat may help you with your patent search are some definitions and terms that you may or may not be familiar with, what\nis and isn\u2019t patentable, and how to get a United\nStates patent. Patent search Definitions\nEven\nthough you are more than likely familiar with some of the following words, they\nmight have slightly different meaning in this context.\nPatent:\nright of ownership granted by the government to a person that gives the owner\nthe right to exclude others from making, selling or using the claimed product. Also referred to as trade marks. Product:\na new and useful article, machine, composition, or process, devised as a result\nof someone\u2019s imagination. Patent\nApplications: a document describing a product in detail, which is to be\nsubmitted to a patent office with\nthe aim of obtaining a patent on the product. Reduction to Practice: an in depth\ndescription of how the product works, described in concrete terms. Prior Art: the existing or publicly\navailable knowledge available before the date of a product or more than one year prior to the first patent application date.Types of PatentsThere are three main kinds of patents that you can get. Each one differs based on the nature of\nyour product, and are as follows:Utility - Utility is the most common kind of trade mark and includes any inventions that function in a new and\nuseful manner.Design - As implied by the name, this type of patent focuses on design rather than function. This type of patent relies on the product\u2019s unique form or appearance. \u00a0Plant - You might not have thought that plants were patentable, but\nany new varieties of asexually reproduced plants can be patented. A plant breeder can patent different types of dahlias or\nlilies.\nWhat\nis Patentable?Now, let\u2019s take a look at what\ninventions can be patented under\neach of these three different kinds of patents.\nFirst off we have inventions of utility; inventions of utility have to fall\ninto one of five different statutory classes in order to be considered patentable.\nThese are the following: Process \u2013 this includes conventional\nprocesses as well as software processes. Machines \u2013 this includes both\nconventional machines and software machines. Machines are also often defined as\nhaving moving parts, such as a fridge or a DVD player. Manufactures products \u2013 these are\nconsidered to be items that don\u2019t have moving parts, like books or coffee\ntables.\nCompositions\nof matter \u2013 examples of this include any pharmaceuticals, alloys, or chemicals.\nNew\nuses of any of the aboveBesides fitting into one of the above\ncategories, the product that you\nwant to trademark must be useful.\nThere are, however, different definitions of useful. For instance, some might\npeople might not consider board games to be useful, but they\u2019re meant to be\nused for entertainment, at which they succeed.\nWhatever you want to patent must also be uniquely your intellectual property. That doesn\u2019t\nmean that it can\u2019t be similar to something else, but it must have something\nunique about it. For instance, take toasters vs. toaster ovens. They are\ndefinitely similar in nature, yet they have unique aspects that make them\ndifferent products.\nLast but not least, your product must not be completely obvious\nto other independent inventors. This\nmeans that your product would not\nseem obvious to someone who has knowledge and experience in the area that your product fits into. For example, if all\nmicrowaves were black and you \u2018invented\u2019 a red microwave and tried to patent it, it wouldn\u2019t work.\nWhat Generally Can\u2019t You Patent?\nNow let\u2019s\nlook at things that, generally speaking, you cannot patent. These\ninclude merely changing an existing product\u2019s size, form, or shape.\nInventions where you\u2019ve merely added on some parts or taken some parts away\nfrom someone else\u2019s product are not considered unique, either.\nAlong with\ntrying to blatantly steal other people\u2019s ideas, you\u2019re not allowed to patent abstract ideas, physical phenomena, and the laws of nature. All literary,\ndramatic, musical and artistic works should be protected by copyright laws, so you can\u2019t try to patent those either. And, just in case you\nwere getting any ideas, you can\u2019t get a patent for a product that\nis against the laws of nature or whose only use is illegal in nature.\nHow Do You Do a Patent search?\nThe best and easiest way to do a patent search is by patent classification. A Patent Classification is a code used to\ncategorize a product. These\nclassifications are normally shown with the class of the product first, followed by a slash and the subclass of product. Classes and subclasses have\ntitles which provide a short description and/or definition of the class or\nsubclass. Many Classes and subclasses have explicitly defined relationships to\none another, which lets you search patents more easily.\nThere are a lot of internet patent search systems, and one of the top level domains is Google patents.\nIf you do an internet patent search using\nGoogle\u2019s patent search system, you\ncan just type in a word. If you type in the word \u201cspork,\u201d you will find a\nfoldable spork that is currently listed as patent D07/643. If you read on, you will\nfind that sporks fall under the class of D07: \u201cEquipment for preparing or\nserving food or drink not elsewhere specified,\u201d and within the subclass of 643:\n\u201ccombination or integral form of fork and spoon.\u201d\nHow Do I Get My Patent?\nOkay, let\u2019s say you\u2019ve made sure that\nyour product fits the requirements\nand you did a thorough patent search to make sure that your patent won\u2019t\ninfringe on someone else\u2019s intellectual property.\nNow, how do you go about getting your patent? First\noff, you need to fill out a patent application.\nKeep in mind, patent applications are\nlegal documents where you will need\nto describe your product in\nconsiderable detail.

However in practice, it is at the discretion of the professional to determine whether a medical event is at all related to the therapy.As a result, routine adverse effects reporting often may not include long-term and subtle effects that may ultimately be attributed to a therapy.Keep a checklist of all the prescription and over-the-counter medications you take.

Ask the following questions and write down the answers before leaving the doctor\u2019s office. What is the name of the medicine and why am I taking it? What is the name of the condition this medicine will treat? How long will it take to work? How should I store the medication? Does it need to be refrigerated?\tCan the pharmacist substitute a less expensive, generic form of the medicine?\t\t\t\t\tSubmit Your Side EffectsDrugs are composed of chemicals and we all react differently to them. If a drug has active ingredients, it has side effects and can interfere with normal body functions. Everybody's immune system functions a little differently. Some people's bodies react to certain chemicals while others do not. This could depend on gender, age, blood type, etc. Every single drug has side effects because once it enters the blood stream it passes through the body. \t\t\t\t\tWhen physicians prescribe drugs, they must weigh the risks against the benefits. Many times, the risks and side effects are outweighed by the benefits of the drug. Most drugs aim to affect processes in a particular part of the body that may be functioning abnormally. In most cases, the targeted process often exists in many other parts of the body and so the drug will affect all areas, even in the non-target areas. Furthermore, all drugs are chemical compounds and too much of these can be damaging to our cells, which lead to generalised side effects as a result of tissue damage in certain regions. \t\t\t\t\tOften side effects are due to the non-selective nature of a drug. New drugs are getting more targeted but even these still affect unwanted parts of the body. Experts say that side effects vary for each patient, and depend largely on their general health, the state of their disease, age, weight, and gender. Frequently drug side effects are closely linked to dosage, which may be altered. Other areas to watch for are drug-drug interactions (if the patient is taking two drugs), drug-food interactions (when a particular food alters what the drug should be doing) and drug-herb interactions. \t\t\t\t\t It is very important to keep track of all side effects and discuss them with your doctor. If you think you may have a medical emergency, call your doctor or 911 immediately. Most drugs have a long list of nonsevere, mild adverse effects which do not prevent continued usage. These side effects, which depend on individual sensitivity, can include nausea, dizziness, diarrhea, malaise, vomiting, headache, dermatitis, dry mouth, etc. Not all drug users experience these side effects and some users do not have them. Patients should be fully informed about side effects, track them and discuss with their doctors. \t\t\t\t\t Submit a Side Effect Report Include health symptoms (e.g.fatigue, sleeplessness, nausea, other); reason for taking medication or diagnosis; dosage and frequency; Outcomes Attributed to Side Effects (e.g. Life-threatening, Hospitalization - initial or prolonged, Disability or Permanent Damage, Congenital Anomaly/Birth Defect); Required Intervention to Prevent Permanent Damage, Important Medical Events; Relevant History and Preexisting Medical Conditions (e.g. allergies, race, pregnancy, smoking and alcohol use, liver/kidney problems,etc.) \t\t\t\t\t How bad were drug side effects?

Please be patient. Then we soon translated the rest of the pages.Geographical location of PhuketI am sharing my experience gathered throughout the years for anyone planning a vacation to Patong Beach and to the island of Phuket. This includes information and tips on what kinds of payment are suitable, how to cheaply call within Thailand or what visa you need for a stay in Thailand. I will describe beaches, sights, nightlife and the islands around Patong for you on these pages.Pack your bags and let\u2019s go to Phuket!It is easier said then done. Once you have decided to go to the Land of Smiles for a vacation, just follow the tips that I try to give you on these pages. Then you will surely experience an unforgettable vacation. It has happened frequently that one or the other has packed his suitcase more quickly and has strayed back to Phuket then he thought. Many even stay and do not even fly back home at all.What is Patong Beach?Patong Beach is located with its beach on the southwest of the island of Phuket. The island of Phuket is located in the south of Thailand. With 540 km2, Phuket is also the largest island in the country. The distance to the equator is about 800 km from here. Since the solar radiation is very high all year due to the proximity to the equator, the temperatures are relatively high and constant through the whole year. Even if the rainy season, during the off-season strongly differs from the main season. I describe the place itself detailed on a separate page with the heading Local \u2013 On the streets of Patong Beach.The size of the island of Phuket is the main reason that the place offers so many opportunities for everyone. Whether it is a family vacation on the beach, a backpacking tour visiting sights or singing in the hubbub of nightlife. Everyone will find something for themselves.Phuket Airport is located in the northern part of the island and Patong Beach is in the south-west. To the southeast is the Panwa Peninsula. From here you can reach many famous islands of the nearby archipelago, such as Kho Phi Phi or the island of Kho Racha.Patong Beach NightlifeThe nightlife of Patong offers discos, bars and live music. Here you can also sit with a cool beer (about 2, \u2013 Euro) at the roadside of the Bangla Rd and watch the people, that walk Bangla Road up and down. This can be amusing and at the same time interesting as people from all over the world are staying here. Because Bangla Rd. is south of Bangkok the most famous party mile of Southeast Asia.Beach & NightlifePatong is one of the few places in Thailand that can offer you almost anything. Quite against all prejudices, as a woman, you can experience as many impressions and beautiful things as everyone else. From the fantastic picturesque beach and bays, to sights and a varied nightlife is everything there. In addition, this place is suitable for almost all generations, as long as one is able to cope with the climate.No matter if beach, sight seeing or nightlife. This is exactly what makes this place so popular with Europeans. As people come from all over the world. In addition, the tropical climate is usually very pleasant at average temperatures of 28 \u00b0 \u2013 32 \u00b0 degrees over 365 days a year and 24 hours a day.Only the rainy season from May to October is different. The temperatures do not change very much and during most of the time this rainy season is characterized by a few short showers. It rarely rains over several days throughout. The temperatures can still drop to 26 \u00b0 degrees.The domestic currency of Thailand is the Thai Baht. Contrary to many other tourist areas, is also paid in this currency. 1, \u2013 Euro is about between 38 and 42 Baht. I deliberately set a somewhat larger framework, as there are daily fluctuations in the currency. If you need the current course, you can calculate the euro against the Thai Baht (THB) using a currency converter.Explore the island of PhuketThere are different ways to explore the island. For those who like to remain independent, there is only one alternative: rent a car or a scooter. That is the only way to get the chance to visit beaches, bays or tourist attractions spontaneously. However, if you do not trust yourself, a Tuc Tuc or a taxi is generally a good alternative. Taxi drivers are willing to negotiate with you if a day trip around the island is planned. And who doesn\u2019t want to travel around Phuket by taxi every day, pays surprisingly little for that.The Thailand VisaFor a stay in Patong Beach as well as in all of Thailand a valid visa is needed. Except for a stay of up to 30 days. If you do not want to stay more than 30 days in Thailand, you will receive an entry form from your airline\u2019s flight crew. With that you already have a residence permit for the duration of up to 30 days. If you wish to stay longer than 30 days in Patong on the island of Phuket and Thailand, you must apply for a visa at the Thai Consulate or the Thai Embassy in Berlin.Prices for phone calls and surfing the internet in ThailandIf you want to take a vacation in Patong Beach or any other place in Thailand, then you may be dependent on cheap phone calls. If you bring a PC or a Smartphone on your trip, you have many opportunities to make a phone call. In the meantime, it is possible to call Germany or within Thailand completely free of charge.German speaking hotels in PatongPatong Beach hotels with staff or owners that can communicate with their guests in German, are particularly popular with people who are not fluent in English. In addition you will find more German speaking guests than elsewhere in these hotels. This is always a good thing to do and to get to know new and partly interesting people.There are more than 1000 hotels in Patong Beach. However, there are very few hotels under German-speaking management. I have looked at some well-known hotels, whose owners or staff speak German. Among them are the Blue Sky Residence in the southeast of the village and the Orchid Residence in the center.Patong Beach 1982This old photo of Patong Beach was kindly left to me by a good friend.

From there I turned it into my hobby and by the time I hit college I learned how to use my art digitally using Photoshop.I have always been greatly inspired by many things, from games to movies and even TV series. If I like something I draw it. Most people call me a fan artist, but I like to think of it as giving me a reason to draw something so I can improve myself for better things. I love what I do, I always have. Without my fans I am nothing, so thank you to everyone who enjoys my work.\nwww.facebook.com/PatrickBrownArt\nInterests\nFavorite visual artist Ryan Ottley Favorite movies Avatar, All Jason Statham movies, Bad Boys 2.. waaaay too many more!

Sunday after church, my friend Jean gave me two cookbooks - Plain & Happy Living Amish Recipes & Remedies by Emma Blyer (Jonas Em) and Dutch Country Cooking - Recipes Compiled from Dutch Country Kitchens. I'm going to enjoy reading Emma Blyer's book with stories and recipes of her life. I recognized\u00a0so many names from the latter book from other Amish cookbooks I have.I needed a casserole for this week so focused on main dishes in the Dutch Country Cooking cookbook. I found two recipes that were very similar - Mrs. Joe J. Miller's Yummy-A-Zetta and Yumzetti by Mrs. Albert Slabach. I know this is crazy but I chose the first one because it called for 1 lb of ground beef and the latter one 1-1/2 lbs. \u00a0Guess how much beef I had. Mrs. Slabach also used velveeta slices and Mrs. Miller's used chunks. I didn't have the slices. The slices would have been easier to cover the dish though. Next time I would add more \"chunks\" to give it more cheese coverage, but I still liked it.YUMMY-A-ZETTA1 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 pk wide noodles (I used about 8 ounces of whole wheat noodles - they measured 6 cups when I measured them dry - the 12 - ounce package was opened)1 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 lb hamburger1 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 can cream of mushroom soup1 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 can tomato soup or juice (I did use the soup)1/2 \u00a0 cup velveeta cheese (cubed)Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.While the noodles are cooking, brown ground beef in skillet.Add the two cans of soup to the cooked beef and stir well. Heat mixture while the water boils and the noodles cook.Drain the cooked noodles and return them to the pot. Add meat mixture and stir to mix well.Pour into casserole (I used a 9 x 13 - inch baking pan.) Put cheese on top and bake til cheese is melted.Mrs. Miller doesn't indicate how long it should bake, so since everything was already cooked and I heated the soup with the meat, I baked mine 15 minutes. If you don't heat the soup/meat mixture, I would cook it longer to heat it through.Posted byPatricia Dunnat6:30 AMNo comments:\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to PinterestLabels:Amish Recipe,Ground Beef,Main Dishes,Pasta\nMonday, April 24, 2017\nVEGETABLE PIZZAI do enjoy winning! I admit it. Don't get me wrong. I have fun just getting together with friends. BUT it is a little more fun to be on the winning side. Thursday our quilters' canasta group met at Friend Dorothy's house and I had a LOT of fun. After we finish the game, we always have time to play a hand or two we call a \"revenge round\" where hopefully the losing team will have better luck and win.\u00a0After dessert (Marie Callender's chocolate pie - OMG), I dealt out the cards for the revenge hand. Then I picked up a cookbook that Dorothy thought I would be interested in checking out. Each time it was my turn to play, I had no idea what cards had been discarded. I could see what cards my partners had laid down and that was easy to add to. The hard part was trying to decide if I should pick up the pile. One time when I could but it didn't feel like many cards in the pile, I said, \"Oh well, we are supposed to let them win this time, aren't we?\" Dorothy, Ellen, and Janice\u00a0didn't think that was as funny as my partners did.\u00a0I ended up drawing two new cards and one of them gave us a clean canasta. \"Good choice, Partner. Good choice,\" said Sharon. We ended up playing two extra hands, but we won anyway. As I said it was a really fun afternoon. (Right, Fran and Sharon?!)But to the real purpose for this post...to share the Vegetable Pizza Dorothy made to share. This is a great appetizer for your next gathering or even a light lunch.VEGETABLE PIZZA2 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a08-oz cans crescent rolls dough1 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 8-oz package cream cheese, softened1 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 teaspoon dried dill weed1/8 \u00a0 \u00a0 teaspoon garlic powderfresh vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, peppers, carrot strips, mushrooms, tomatoes, radishes,...Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.Press the dough into a ungreased 15 x 10 x 1 - inch baking pan to form the crust.Bake for 13 to 17 minutes or until golden brown.

Don't you just love their names?! She decided each Friday that she was going to have one of them come over and bake something with them. Jude, 9, did fairly well but would get distracted with \"things\" in her kitchen. Harrison, 6, she discovered, preferred cleaning up the flour on the counter and floor. He also had fun smashing the peanut butter balls with the fork. Fran said he would say, \"Oh, I'm so sorry - smash.\" over and over as he flattened the balls. Stella Blue,4, was the most involved. She had fun measuring and stirring even though the stirring was a little difficult because the mixture was thick. (I would have loved being a \"fly on the wall\". What memories she was making with her grandchildren!)I had shared a couple of easy recipes with her that might work well with them but then one Friday when Friend Janice and I were out going to estate sales, we ran across two cookbooks for cooking with children. Yes, you know what I did....I bought them and gave them to Fran. Last week she returned them to me along with some other things I had \"given\" her to see if she could use, but didn't realize the cookbooks were there until a day or two ago. (I had told her I was interested in checking them out but never intended for her not to keep them.)Since the cookie jar was empty again, (When you only bake about 2 dozen cookies at a time and you have a husband like I do who enjoys cookies, they don't last long.) I thought I would see what cookie recipes were in the cookbooks. The one I chose to make from the Kids Cook Fabulous Food for the Whole Family by Sarah and Zachary Williamson was actually called Chocolate Chip Crispers. I changed the title because I had some White Peppermint M&Ms I had bought after Christmas I needed to use. They would be good with peanut butter chips, butterscotch chips....you name it. Make them your own. I did make a little over 3-1/2 dozen cookies though so that means they will last a little longer in the cookie jar. Well, maybe. Will see what my husband says. He loves peppermint.WHITE PEPPERMINT CRISPERS1/2 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0cup butter, softened3/4 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 cup sugar1 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0egg1 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0teaspoon vanilla1-1/4 \u00a0 \u00a0 cups flour1/2 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0teaspoon baking soda1/2 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0teaspoon salt2 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 cups Rice Crispies1 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0cup White Peppermint M&Ms (or chocolate chips, or peanut butter chips, or butterscotch chips...)Preheat oven to 350 degrees.Beat butter and sugar in bowl til nice and smooth.

That's what Ella Derweiler from Atlantic, Pennsylvania said about her recipe in Wanda E. Brunstetter's Amish Friends Cookbook - Desserts.I had to make this twice before I could share it with you. Don't get me wrong - it is definitely good enough for me to want to make it again. I had to make again though because I messed up the first time.\u00a0I made it to share with our Sunday school class the first time. We went to see A Case for Christ and then gathered for dessert and discussion afterwards at Friends Connie and Jerry's house. I wasn't happy with the way it looked and it didn't dawn on me why until the next day.You see in the recipe the instructions just say to layer the chocolate and vanilla puddings on top. Reading it literally, I layered the chocolate pudding first and then the vanilla pudding on top of it. I wasn't thinking about the Drumstick Ice Cream or I would have realized the vanilla pudding went first and then the chocolate last. So it didn't look anything like it was supposed to. That's when I decided I would make it again and just wait to share pictures of it the \"right\" way.Knowing the volunteers at Hillcrest Thrift Shop and what they like as far as types of desserts go, it didn't take much thinking on my part to know I would be making it again to take to them. (The dessert had to stay in the refrigerator at the thrift shop so I think some volunteers didn't realize I had brought something. When my shift was over and I was ready to go home, there were about 6 servings left. I just brought the dish home and gave them to the boys next door to enjoy.)DRUMSTICK PUDDING1-1/2 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 cups graham cracker crumbs (all but one graham cracker in a \"sleeve\" if you are making your own crumbs)1/4 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 cup sugar1/4 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 cup (1/2 stick) butter, melted2 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a08 - ounce packages cream cheese, room temperature (I used 1/3 less fat Neutchatel)1/4 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 cup peanut butter1 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 cup powdered sugar2 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0cartons (8 - oz each) whipped topping, thawed1 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a04 - servings size instant vanilla pudding mix\u00a0+ 2 cups milk1 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a06 - servings size instant chocolate pudding mix\u00a0+ 2-3/4 cups milkIn a 9 x 13 - inch dish, combine the cracker crumbs and sugar and then add melted butter.

They were only 99 cents each so I couldn't pass them up. The problem, or almost problem, was I had other things to make right then and just put them in the crisper with the other fruit in my refrigerator. Saturday while looking for something else in the refrigerator, I saw them. The funny thing was right after that I found a recipe for this Blackberry Cobbler with a Pecan Coconut Cookie topping that I had printed sometime. Not sure when and not sure where I saw it. It was inspired by Kathleen Smith from gonnawantseconds.com.I made a few changes and my husband and I were very pleased with the outcome. We started reducing our sugar intake a number of years ago and actually have a hard time eating desserts that are really sweet (like ones I used to make). I was telling my husband the changes I had made and he suggested I tell you that it wasn't real sweet. I reminded him that anyone who likes things \"sweet\" won't be using unsweetened coconut. Using just a little bit less sugar doesn't make that much difference, but using unsweetened coconut will.Since the cobbler was cooled when we finally ate some, we heated our servings (one at a time) in the microwave for 30 seconds. Didn't have any ice cream, but I bet it would taste really good with a scoop if you like ice cream with your cobbler.BLACKBERRY COBBLER with a PECAN COCONUT COOKIE TOPPING4 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 6 - oz pkgs fresh blackberries (a little more than 4 cups)1/2 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0cup sugar2 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 tablespoons instant tapioca1 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0tablespoon fresh lime juice (I used the bottled kind)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 pinch of saltTopping:1 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 cup flour1 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 cup coconut (I used unsweetened coconut)1/2 \u00a0 \u00a0 cup sugar1/2 \u00a0 \u00a0 cup pecans, chopped1/2 \u00a0 \u00a0 teaspoon baking powder1/4 \u00a0 \u00a0 teaspoon salt1/2 \u00a0 \u00a0 cup cold unsalted butter1 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 large egg, slightly beatenPreheat oven to 375 degrees F.In a large bowl sprinkle the lime juice over the berries. Then gently toss the berries with the sugar, tapioca, and salt.\u00a0Pour berries into a 1-1/2 quart baking dish.

Pattaya is home to many bars, gogo bars and night clubs. Most are located in South and central Pattaya but they are to be found all over the city to varying degrees. Estimates seem to vary quite wildly but we would guess there are between 900 and 1200 bars, gogo bars and night clubs in the city itself with more in areas like Jomtien and Nahklua. We are also including the best of the venues in Ban Chang which is a popular strip of bars about 40 kilometres from Pattaya.We are adding bars in Pattaya, and other local area bars, daily and each new listing will show in the Updates page. The easiest way to use the site is to use one of the two search boxes or use the category links in the top navigation bar.If you have a bar or night club that you would like us to add please contact us using the link at the bottom of every page.Walking Street Pattaya barsAlthough the bars are spread all over the city there are over 400 in Walking Street alone. Most of the gogo bars, around 80% of them are also located here.All Walking Street barsPattaya bars \u2013\u00a0site\u00a0news and updatesPattaya Bars Facebook Page \u2013\u00a0https://www.facebook.com/Bars.pattaya/April 6th 2013 \u2013 We have added a new category for Bars with Accommodation.July 5th 2013 \u2013 due to their increasing popularity we have added a new category for Sports Bars.October 2013 \u2013 all Happy Group bars added or updated.January 2014 \u2013 new category added for Ladyboy barsJuly 2016 \u2013 new category added for Live Music barsDecember 2016 \u2013 Events calendar addedJanuary 2017 \u2013 Pattaya videos\u00a0category updatedWhilst we make every effort to keep this site up to date bars and gogo bars are opening, closing and changing names very frequently these days.

Pattaya has over 1000 bars catering to all tastes, from small outdoor\nbeer bars in complexes to indoor \"shop house\" bars and large air conditioned bars, bar complexes, gogo bars\nand clubs playing live music. Some websites say 2000-3000 bars but I think that is highly unlikely The\u00a0Pattaya Bars website\u00a0reviews only the very best bars in Pattaya. Be it a\nsmall beer bar or larger and more \"upmarket\" bar we will add them all if they are good and well liked. We are not interested in the \"bars for the boys\" venues e.g. those established solely for the owners friends\nthat often make other visitors feel unwelcome. Unlike many other websites we will only list the bars we think are worthy of an entry. Please add your comments and reviews on all bars listed on the appropriate page. If you have a favourite bar you think should be included in this website please use the suggest a bar page. If you are a bar owner or manager and would like us to add your bar please go to our Owners page. Once you have told us as much as you\ncan someone will come and pay you a visit. At very least you will sell a couple of beers so give us a try.\nFeatured\nFeatured\nLatest Additions Pussy Club Soi 6 Night Wish Soi 6 Pandora Soi 7 Sapphire Lodge Gentlemens Club Scoobys Jomtien New

I am not sure why - but the lack of response meant that it would have been difficult to shortlist the drawing chosen.Anyway enough of the moaning, and on a positive note I have spent the last month getting ready for my first exhibition in the UK. \u00a0I will be attending the Cornwall Art Fair (LINK\u00a0) that runs from Thursday 22nd April through to Sunday the 24th April. \u00a0I have arranged for all of my most popular pieces to be on display..And many more besides - I will also be selling a number of limited edition prints - unframed and framed at a reasonable price.I realise Cornwall\u00a0isn't\u00a0accessible for everyone, so I will be tweeting (paul_stowe) \u00a0on an regular basis throughout the 3 days, and will create a journal entry for DA after the show. \u00a0If you are able to come along - pop me a note or a comment and I will let you have all the details and make sure you gain free entry \u00a0Skin by SimplySilent\n43 Comments\nUpdate April 2016 April 14, 2016 43 Comments 2 Favourites\nMore Journal Entries\nWhich of the following is the most important to you?

Please note, the original email has been changed slightly, to protect this individual from being identified.\nHi Paul,\nI read your July 2010 article on ColdFusion v PHP, and am curious if there may be any updates on your opinions.\nOur website (www.websitenameremoved.com\u00a0which is a shell (link to three other separate sites)uses PHP and Joomla CMS. \u00a0Due to serious hacking issues precipitated by use of an old version of Joomla (1.5) we have decided to rebuild our site rather than upgrade. \u00a0I had an analysis completed; one option mentioned is ColdFusion together with Mura CMS, a second option is PHP with Joomla 3.1. \u00a0Do you have any opinions or comments that may help with our decision..?\nThis was my reply....\nHi, In my opinion, the best open source CMS option out there is by far Wordpress. Now I know your probably not a huge fan of php technologies especially after what happened but the key is to make sure you upgrade as often as possible. Now, looking briefly at your site, it looked somewhat like an ecommerce website, for ecommerce my personal favorite is Magento.\u00a0http://magento.com/ As far as Mura CMS and ColdFusion goes, I have been writing ColdFusion for 6 years now, it's a great language but if I was to start over, I wouldn't use anything ColdFusion based. The reason being, although it's a great language and is pretty easy to learn, there are SO few people who actually know it that it makes finding people who support ColdFusion sites almost impossible. If your contracting this through an agency, as long as your with that agency there probably won't be a problem with this however, most companies I've worked at liked to change agencies every few years just to keep the blood flowing. So many agencies honestly don't know ColdFusion and just butcher sites up which behind the scenes just makes things more expensive to support. My recommendation would be to go with a solution that's either .net, php or completely custom. The major downside to open source technologies is that everyone and their mother have access to your code and there are hundreds and thousands of automated hack-bots that are constantly looking for out of date open source scripts to just automatically hack them. This is actually why I tend to go toward custom rather than open based code systems. Another issue with open code systems, is that they become difficult to upgrade to new versions as custom modification are made; especially if these custom mods weren't implemented properly. Having said that, I've used Magento and Wordpress dozens of times and never had issues and as long as I made my mods correctly, the upgrades could just occur from inside of the admin console and it was always a breeze. Hope this helped! Paul Alkema http://paulalkema.com/\nSo what are your thoughts? Do you agree with my advice, or do you think ColdFusion is the way to go?\n\u2192 No CommentsTags: ColdFusion\nHow To Spoof Any Email | Send Emails To Anyone, From Anyone, Anonymously May 02, 2013 \u00b7 By Paul Alkema \u00b7 No Comments\nHow To Spoof Emails Spoofing emails used to be a pain, you needed to find an open relay server and build an application that used that open relay server to send email on behalf of a specified email address. Well things just got a whole lot easier. OpenInboxExperiment.com is a communal inbox that\u2019s open to the public. One special feature of this, is the ability to send email however, one awesome feature of this is that the emails don\u2019t need to come from anyone specific, but can be sent from the email address specified. IE; you can spoof someone\u2019s email, without having to find a relay server and build an application to do it, this application is already built and open to the public. Best of all, this service is completely anonymous and according to the website, doesn't save any information about the emails being sent.\n[Read more \u2192]\n\u2192 No CommentsTags: Security\nWhat Ever Happened To Geocities?

Because they made so many changes from the last version, they changed the name to Kali Linux. The new version is faster, more than 300 tools, easier to update, Debian compliant and the install is a breeze. In addition, they created a new website dedicated to Kali Linux\u00a0which is excellent considering the old backtrack website really needed a facelift. But hey, give me more than 300 tools in linux distro, who am I to complain? When I heard there was a new version of Backtrack, I almost fell off my chair. I've been on some hacker forums, specifically\u00a0hackforums.net\u00a0and many of them have nitpicked it, in my opinion, people like what they know and when things change, many people don't like change. What i've found, is the new version of Kali Linux is at least for me, much faster, more reliable and the tools are much more up to date. \u00a0I did a fresh install on one of my \"Test\" boxes and the install was much more smooth than I've had installing Backtrack. I've run it virtualized since then and found it awesome virtualized as well. If you havn't already, I would highly recommend downloading it.

A small handful of applications relied on that drive letter and would break if the drive letter wasn't changed before deployment. In these specific scenarios, I couldn't call expandPath() or getTemplatePath() directly because the application wasn't in the root of the website. My solution to this issue was to put the code below in my application.cfm / application.cfc file which sets an application variable called \"driveLetter\" to the applications current drive letter; then I call the application variable instead of the static drive letter that could change. Get Drive letter If you want to get the drive letter once, you could use do something like below.\n<cfset variables.driveLetter = listGetAt(expandPath('\\'),1,'\\')&'\\' />\nGet drive letter, then set application variable. Below is the exact code I used in my application.cfm file to set the application variable initially, that way I don't have to run the script every time.\n<cfif !isDefined('application.driveLetter')>\n<cflock scope='application' timeout='5'>\n<cfset application.driveLetter = listGetAt(expandPath('\\'),1,'\\')&'\\'/>\n</cflock>\n</cfif>\n\u2192 53 CommentsTags: ColdFusion\n960 CSS Framework November 30, 2010 \u00b7 By Paul Alkema \u00b7 73 Comments\nAbout 960 I was recently introduced to a css framework called 960. At first I was EXTREMELY skeptical, but after using it and actually looking at the code behind it, I have officially become a 960 fan. First off, let me start by saying this css framework isn't going to solve all of your css issues but it will most definitively help. The way that 960 works is it puts everything into a grid. You have 3 options, the 12 column grid, the 16 column grid and the 24 column grid. I personally prefer the 16 column grid but it's really just a personal preference. A down side to using 960 is that it restricts your design to this grid. This in my opinion makes things look really nice and organized but some designers might not like having this limitation. Another downside is that you really need to be disciplined to not add any margin or padding on the left or right of any of your div's as this breaks the grid. The upside, is that it really helps things to be pixel perfect and consistent. I've had issues before with css where in one spot something might be 10px away then on a different page it's 11px away. Why? Usually something stupid; 960 will usually take cialis super active care of these types of issues. Also, it really helps css be more cross compatible. How To Use It In this example I'm going to explain how to create a basic header, body, footer template. Lets start by importing the 960 grid onto our page. You should download the zip file located on 960's website and import the css into your file. You should also create a css file specific to your page, I'm going to use the file custom.css in this example.\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/reset.css\" /> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/960.css\" /> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/custom.css\" />\nIn my custom css file I put classes used to define the height and background colors of each divs. Most of the time defined heights are not necessary as content that is normally inside of the div created my height however my example contains no content so this was necessary. When using 960 adding margin or padding, top and bottom are allowed along with adding defined height however margin and padding on the left or right side along with defined widths are not recommended as this breaks the 960 grid.\n/* sets background color to gray */ body { background-color:#CCC; color:#FFF; } /*set foreground color to white */ .container_16 { background-color:#FFF; } /* set heights and backgrounds for my containers. */ #header { height:120px; background-color:#000; } #nav { height:32px; background-color:#999; } #body { background-color:#FFF; min-height:400px; } #footer { background-color:#666; min-height:154px; } /* set heights and background colors for my children divs. */ #body div{ margin-top:10px; background-color:#333; height:380px; } #footer div { margin-top:10px; background-color:#CCC; height:134px; }\nThe html for this is very basic; Just 4 divs with the container_16 class. This class is used only on containers where you want the full 16 column with.\n<div class=\"container_16\" id=\"header\"> Header </div> <div class=\"container_16\" id=\"nav\"> Nav </div> <div class=\"container_16\" id=\"body\"> Body </div> <div class=\"container_16\" id=\"footer\"> Footer </div>\nWhen we put divs inside our containers we need to use the grid_## class. This class should only be used inside of the container class and if the number proceeding the underscore is less than 16, than it should always be used in conjunction with other divs that equal 16. Also, one of the awesome things about 960 is that not only can you use divs to do some of these things but you can use li's, h1's, h2's and pretty much any other html tag.\n<div class=\"container_16\" id=\"header\"> <div class=\"grid_16\"> Header </div> </div> <div class=\"container_16\" id=\"nav\"> <ul> <li class=\"grid_2\"> Nav 1 </li> <li class=\"grid_2\"> Nav 2 </li> <li class=\"grid_2\"> Nav 3 </li> <li class=\"grid_2\"> Nav 4 </li> <li class=\"grid_2\"> Nav 5 </li> <li class=\"grid_2\"> Nav 6 </li> <li class=\"grid_2\"> Nav 7 </li> <li class=\"grid_2\"> Nav 8 </li> </ul> </div> <div class=\"container_16\" id=\"body\"> <div class=\"grid_4\"> Body Column 1 </div> <div class=\"grid_4\"> Body Column 2 </div> <div class=\"grid_4\"> Body Column 3 </div> <div class=\"grid_4\"> Body Column 4 </div> </div> <div class=\"container_16\" id=\"footer\"> <div class=\"grid_4\"> Footer Column 1 </div> <div class=\"grid_4\"> Footer Column 2 </div> <div class=\"grid_4\"> Footer Column 3 </div> <div class=\"grid_4\"> Footer Column 4 </div> </div>\nThere is more to it, but this is the basics so PLEASE, make sure you check it out.

On Oct. 12th 2010 on the official Google blog they announced that they are working on a self driving car. A car that drives itself! Not only did they say that they\u2019re working on this awesome car, but according to their blog, they already have a working prototype.\n\"So we have developed technology for cars that can drive themselves. Our automated cars, manned by trained operators, just drove from our Mountain View campus to our Santa Monica office and on to Hollywood Boulevard. They\u2019ve driven down Lombard Street, crossed the Golden Gate bridge, navigated the Pacific Coast Highway, and even made it all the way around Lake Tahoe. All in all, our self-driving cars have logged over 140,000 miles. We think this is a first in robotics research.\" - Google\nhttp://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/10/what-were-driving-at.html\n\u2192 27 CommentsTags: Misc\n\u2190 Previous Entries\nAbout Paul Alkema is currently a web developer specializing in ColdFusion, MSSQL, XHTML, HTML, Javascript, CSS, PHP and MYSQL for creating Content Management systems and web-based applications.\nRecent Entries\nMura CMS vs Wordpress vs Magento12.06 How To Spoof Any Email | Send Emails To Anyone, From Anyone, Anonymously5.02 What Ever Happened To Geocities?4.22 Kali Linux Review4.22 Automatically Crack All Wi-Fi Routers WEP Key's With Only 30\nSeconds worth of Work2.15 Visit the archives for more!\nCategories\nColdFusion\nCSS\nJavascript\nMisc\nphp\nSecurity\nSQL\nSearch It!\nTag Cloud\ncoldfusion security misc css sql php javascript\nMonthly Archives\nDecember 2013 (1) May 2013 (1) April 2013 (2) February 2013 (2) May 2011 (2) November 2010 (1)\nFavorite Links\nBen Forta Ben Nadel Coldfusion Bloggers Philly CFUG Raymond Camden", "mostFrequentWord": ">", "topic4": 1, "topImportantWord": "TODO!!!!", "id": 171, "topic12": 1}, {"lang": "en", "topic8": 4, "topic2": 1, "url": "http://pauldenton.co.uk", "text": "About Me Say Hey!\nGuestbook\nJoin us onFacebook\nHome\nShowprep\nRadio Info\nRadio Industry Index Radio Webcams Radio Job Profiles Radio Jargon Webpoll Archive Radio Jingles Anoraks Corner Radio Links\nRadio News\nLatest Music News Latest Radio News Latest Radio Jobs News Headlines Sport News Showbiz News Radio Forum\nHow To Guides\nMake A Demo Be A Voice Over Set Up Home Studio Be A Newsreader Presenting Tips\nTravel Guides\nHong Kong Sri Lanka Rome Thailand Venice Singapore Australia Dubai Egypt Las Vegas New York Orlando San Francisco Tenerife Washington D.C.

He fought in the war but was always cheerful. He buried first his child (my mother) and then his wife before him. He was incredibly strong and he shaped how I believe a true gentleman should be. His passing was peaceful, but it doesn't stop me wishing that he was still here. There's still so much more that I could learn from him. If only I could have seen him one last time.This journal will be filled with peaceful art themed around the colour white. White is not only a peaceful and pure colour, but it can also symbolize loneliness and loss.I have picked thematic art from different medias. There are some to calm us, some that remind me of grandfather, and some that simply deserve more recognition.We are blessed with those we have in our lives.

Implicit flow is appropriate when the current user is authenticated to a common identity provider (e.g. Azure Active Directory a.k.a AAD) and the client (the environment requesting the token) is not secure. A great example of this is making a call to the Microsoft Graph from a page in SharePoint Online using only JavaScript.The ADAL.js library exists as a solution to all five of the OAuth grants specifically when working against AAD as the identity provider. Unfortunately, it is currently not well maintained and is over complicated. From a user experience perspective, the implementation discussed in this post avoids the need to redirect in order to authenticate. It happens seamlessly in the background via a hidden iframe. Azure Active DirectoryA great article on the OAuth grants, agnostic of implementation, can be found here.Thanks to my colleague Paul Lawrence for writing the first iteration of this code.This code has a dependency on jQuery, mostly just for promises. I know, old school. I expect I\u2019ll write an es6/2016 version of this soon enough but it shouldn\u2019t be a challenge to convert this code yourself.As I know I\u2019ll get comments about it if I don\u2019t mention it, this code doesn\u2019t send and verify a state token as part of the grant flow. This is optional as far as the OAuth specification is concerned but it should be done as an additional security measure.Although I\u2019m Microsoft stack developer and have only tested this with AAD as the identity provider, I believe that it should work for any identify provider that adheres to the OAuth specification for authentication. You would need to play around with the authorisation server URL as login.microsoftonline.com is specifically for authenticating to AAD. I\u2019d love feedback on this.By definition, the OAuth implicit flow grant does not return a refresh token. Furthermore, the access token has a short lifetime, an hour I believe, and credentials must be re-entered before additional access tokens can be obtained via the implicit flow grant. The code provided in this post handles this by returning a URL which can be used to re-authenticate when a request fails. This URL can be used behind a link or redirection could be forced to occur automatically.The following code snippet is an example of using this implicit flow library to call into the Microsoft Graph from within the context of a SharePoint Online page.You will need to provide an appropriate AAD app ID for your AAD app. And don\u2019t forget that you need to enable implicit flow via the app manifest and associate the correct delegate permissions.This code should work not only with the Microsoft Graph but also to SharePoint Online endpoints, other AAD secured resources such as Azure services or your own AAD secured and CORS enabled web API.[See note above about identity providers other than AAD]var aadAppClientId = \"8BE5AA0E-F900-4BDF-A7CF-71B3CC53B78E\";var resource = \"https://graph.microsoft.com\"var query = \"/v1.0/me/events\";var tokenFactory = new CC.CORE.Adal.AppTokenFactory(aadAppClientId, resource);tokenFactory.ExecuteQuery(query).done(function (response) {\t// Success!}).fail(function (response) {\t// NOTE: Provide a link to renew an expired or yet to be approved session:\t// \"Sorry, your session has expired or requires your approval. \t// <div><a href='\" + response.authorizeUrl + \"'>Click here to sign in</a></div>\";});Here is the implicit flow library code itself.var CC = CC || {};CC.CORE = CC.CORE || {};CC.CORE.Log = function (errMsg) {\n// console.log is undefined in IE10 and earlier unless in debug mode, so must check for it\nif (typeof window.console === \"object\" && typeof console.log === \"function\") {\nconsole.log(errMsg);\n}};CC.CORE.Adal = (function () {\n\"use strict\";\nvar appTokenFactory = function (aadAppClientId, resource) {\n// redirectUrl is the URL which the iframe will redirect to once auth occurs.\n// we use blank.gif as it is a very low payload\nvar redirectUrl = _spPageContextInfo.webAbsoluteUrl + \"/_layouts/images/blank.gif\";\n// NOTE on security: include the userId in the cache key to prevent the case where a user logs out but\n// leaves the tab open and a new user logs in on the same tab.

In order to really get into it and start making great new web parts a developer needs to get a handle on TypeScript. The initial preview iteration of the SPFx shipped with very strict linting rules (tslint) and it forced (in)experienced developers to follow many best practices regarding not just typescript but es6/es2015 conventions as well. This was done by reporting linting errors as build failures as part of the Glup build chain.Later drops of the SharePoint Framework have relaxed these linting rules but it is still less than ideal only being prompted about these issues at transpile/compile-time. The set of linting rules that is used in the build process is defined in a tslint.json file within the root config folder.The tslint file that is provided by the SPFx generatorWhen it comes to developing SPFx web parts I have found Visual Studio Code to be great, as it is lightweight has an integrated terminal and github support and has extensions \u2013 noticeably a nice tslint extension. Unfortunately this extension does not support the JSON format nor all of the rules specified in tslint file provided by SPFx generator.The TSLint VS Code extensionSo here it is, my SPFx tslint file for use in VS Code. Just drop this file in the root of your src directory.Add this tslint file to the root of the src folderThe following file is based on a core set of rules from SPFx Drop 2 with the incompatible rules removed and I\u2019ve taken some liberty by adding my own preferred rules. Of course you can change these as you need, a list of the rules which the extension supports can be found here. I have also included an \u2018extended\u2019 version of the tslint file that is provided in the config folder further below.tslint.json in the src folder:{\n\"rules\": {\n// Following not supported by tslint - breaks the linter!\n// \"export-name\": false,\n// \"no-duplicate-case\": true,\n// \"no-function-expression\": true,\n// \"no-unnecessary-semicolons\": true,\n// \"no-unused-imports\": true,\n// \"no-use-before-declare\": true,\n// \"no-with-statement\": true,\n// \"use-named-parameter\": true,\n// \"valid-typeof\": true,\n// \"prefer-const\": true,\n// \"a11y-role\": true,\n// \"member-ordering\": [false],\n// \"no-constant-condition\": [false],\n\"class-name\": false,\n\"forin\": false,\n\"label-position\": false,\n\"label-undefined\": false,\n\"member-access\": true,\n\"no-arg\": false,\n\"no-console\": [true, \"log\", \"error\"],\n\"no-construct\": false,\n\"no-duplicate-key\": false,\n\"no-duplicate-variable\": true,\n\"no-eval\": false,\n\"no-internal-module\": true,\n\"no-shadowed-variable\": true,\n\"no-switch-case-fall-through\": true,\n\"no-unused-expression\": true,\n\"no-unused-variable\": true,\n\"no-unreachable\": true,\n\"semicolon\": [true, \"always\"],\n\"typedef\": [true, \"call-signature\", \"parameter\", \"member-variable-declaration\", \"property-declaration\"],\n\"typedef-whitespace\": [\ntrue,\n{\n\"call-signature\": \"nospace\",\n\"index-signature\": \"nospace\",\n\"parameter\": \"nospace\",\n\"property-declaration\": \"nospace\",\n\"variable-declaration\": \"nospace\"\n},\n{\n\"call-signature\": \"onespace\",\n\"index-signature\": \"onespace\",\n\"parameter\": \"onespace\",\n\"property-declaration\": \"onespace\",\n\"variable-declaration\": \"onespace\"\n}\n],\n\"variable-name\": false,\n\"whitespace\": [false],\n\"no-constructor-vars\": true,\n\"comment-format\": [true, \"check-space\"],\n\"curly\": false,\n\"indent\": [false],\n\"interface-name\": [true, \"always-prefix\"],\n\"max-line-length\": [true, 180],\n\"no-any\": false,\n\"no-bitwise\": false,\n\"no-consecutive-blank-lines\": true,\n\"no-debugger\": false,\n\"no-empty\": true,\n\"no-null-keyword\": false,\n\"no-string-literal\": false,\n\"no-trailing-whitespace\": false,\n\"no-var-keyword\": true,\n\"one-line\": [true, \"check-open-brace\"],\n\"quotemark\": [true, \"double\", \"jsx-double\", \"avoid-escape\"],\n\"radix\": false,\n\"triple-equals\": true,\n\"trailing-comma\": [true, {\"multiline\": \"never\", \"singleline\": \"never\"}],\n\"object-literal-sort-keys\": false\n}}tslint.json in the config folder:{\n// Display errors as warnings\n\"displayAsWarning\": true,\n// The TSLint task may have been configured with several custom lint rules\n// before this config file is read (for example lint rules from the tslint-microsoft-contrib\n// project).

This means you *may* get a Yammer network provisioned at the *.onmicrosoft.com domain associated with your tenancy.Yammer network using a *.onmicrosoft.com domainHere\u2019s a tipIf you want to take advantage of this make sure that you create the tenancy as a Trial and then buy licences later. Taking this approach means you get the Yammer \u2018on by default\u2019 experience more or less as you would expect, it will be provisioned within a hour or so (maybe sooner). If you instead purchase a tenant right away, they apparently wait a while as the expectation is that you\u2019ll want to use a vanity domain for your Yammer network\u2026 \u201cBut I want Yammer \u2018on by default\u2019 with my paid tenancy\u201d!

Photos are stored in Active Directory (AD) on-premises, Azure Active Directory (AAD), Exchange Online (EXO), SharePoint Online (SPO), and at first appearances possibly elsewhere as well (where does my Delve profile picture live, what about my Skype for Business (SfB) avatar?).I have put together a flow diagram to represent how this actually works. It aims to demonstrate where user photos are stored and where different applications fetch user photos from (if they don\u2019t store the images), and leads to some recommendations about user photo synchronisation. Please note the date of this article (August 2016) and be conscious that Office 365 is changing rapidly and the following recommendations may have changed (e.g. Prior to the Delve user profile page, the SharePoint user profile page referenced images stored in SharePoint rather than Exchange. Changes such as these will continue to evolve). User photos: the diagramUser photos flow in Office 365Where applications store and fetch user photosPhoto LocationCommentsSizeIs source?On-premises AD DS in the thumbnailPhoto attribute100Kb maximumRecommended to be96\u00d796 or 48\u00d748YesAzure AD in the thumbnailPhoto attribute100Kb maximumUsually synced from AD DS via Azure AD ConnectRecommended to be96\u00d796 or 48\u00d748No.Sync from ADExchange Online as property of the mailbox500KbProvided manually by users or a bulk import can be scripted if source photos can be located and named appropriately.If not provided, Exchange will reference the AAD thumbnailPhoto in some instances but only if the thumbnailPhoto is less than 10Kb.Does not sync back to ADRecommended to be648\u00d7648YesSharePoint Online \u2018User Photos\u2019 libraryThree renditions of the EXO photo are automatically created in SharePoint after upload to EXO.It generally takes up to 72 hours to see changes to EXO photo here. Sometimes we see that a user must \u2018touch\u2019 their profile before the sync will be performed.NOTE: Updating user profile photo via Delve profile is actually updating EXO profile photo and not performing any actions directly in SharePoint Online.Small is 48 x 48,Medium is 72 x 72,Large changes depending on the source image but is always square. I have seen as small as 120 x 120 and as large as 300 x 300. PnP image upload solution uploads these as 200 x 200.No.Sync from EXOSkype for BusinessDoes not store any imagesUses the high resolution Exchange image if available, otherwise uses the AD thumbnailPhotoEXO image or AD thumbnailPhotoNo.Read from EXODelve user profileDoes not store any imagesUses the high resolution Exchange image if available, otherwise uses the AD thumbnailPhotoEXO image or AD thumbnailPhotoNo.Read from EXOYammerAlso stores its own photo. Out of scope of this discussion for now.YesLikely issues and resolutionsIssueResolutionExchange Online user photo is low quality (and in turn so is the SPO photo and SfB photo)The source image coming from AD was/is low quality.EXO user photos can be updated by users individually or if high res source photos are available this import can be scripted.Source images should be jpg of 648\u00d7648 (resizing and compression can also be scripted)Exchange Online user photo is high quality but SfB photo is low qualityHigh resolution photos from Exchange will be used as long as both Exchange and Sfb/Lync are of new enough versions (2013 or greater) and SfB is configured to allow all photos (not just those from AD).NB. If a user doesn\u2019t have a mailbox (e.g. not licenced) then they will be displayed using the AD photoThere is no Exchange Online user photo (and in turn there is no SPO photo or SfB photo)A photo has not been imported to the user\u2019s EXO mailbox and the AAD thumbnailPhoto either doesn\u2019t not contain an image or that image is greater than 10Kb.Import of photos up to 500Kb to EXO mailbox can be scripted (the source images could be on a file share, or AAD).Changes to user photos are reflected quickly in Exchange and Skype but take days to replicate to SPOExchange to SPO synchronisation is a periodic process and can take up to 72 hours.A custom solution can perform this replication on demand (e.g. at the same time EXO user photos are set)User photos changed in other systems which update AD are not reflected in EXO, SPO, SfB.E.g. A user in an on-premises SharePoint farm updates their user photoWhen AD is updated, it is synchronised with AAD but that is as far as it gets as the \u201csync\u201d from AAD to EXO is one-off import rather than a Sync.Unlikely to be desirable to create a custom sync relationship here as users will want to be able to update EXO directly and won\u2019t want their photo\u2019s overwrittenUser photos updated in EXO aren\u2019t replicated to other systems which share an AD.E.g. An on-premises SharePoint farmThe user photo in EXO is not synched back to AD \u2013 it can\u2019t be consistently as the AD thumbnailPhoto attribute only supports photos up to 100Kb where EXO supports larger images.Potential for a custom solution to sync images back to AD after having resized/compressed them to <100kb \u2013 However general recommendation is that AD thumbnailPhoto optimal size is 10Kb and 96\u00d796.RecommendationsUse Exchange user photos as the master. Allow users to update their user photos but pre-populate their user photo if possible and before end users are provided any access to the system.If high resolution photos are available, script import of high resolution photos (648\u00d7648) to Exchange Online (see Set-UserPhoto and this). These will then be visible in Exchange, in Skype, and, once processed, in SharePoint Online. In a dispersed\u00a0environment this may have to be managed by many teams rather than trying to compile a single list of all user photos.Users may then update their user profile photo directly via Outlook or indirectly via their Delve profile.If synchronisation back to\u00a0AD is required in order serve other applications (e.g. an on-premises SharePoint farm) then a custom solution could provide synchronisation from EXO to AD but this process should\u00a0compress and shrink images as the recommended size of thumbnailPhoto images is only\u00a096\u00d796 and 10Kb.Paul.\nActive DirectoryExchange OnlineIT ProOffice 365SharePoint OnlineSkype for BusinessUser photos\nTechnical Tip\nAzure AD app wildcard Reply URL\nJuly 7, 2016 Paul Ryan 4 Comments\nAzure AD apps (a.k.a Azure Active Directory apps, a.k.a AAD apps) are an essential component when interacting with Office 365 data outside of SharePoint \u2013 Mail, Calendar, Groups, etc. As an O365 developer I have found myself writing JavaScript code against AAD apps (using ADAl.js) and often, especially during development, found myself entering a long list of Reply URLs. Reply URLs must be specified for any location from which authentication to AAD occurs. From a practical standpoint this results in someone (an Azure Administrator) having to update the list of Reply URLs every time a web part is inserted into a page or a new site is provisioned which relies on an Azure AD app.If this is not done, the user is redirected to Azure login failure with \u2018The reply address \u2026 does not match the reply addresses configured for the application\u2019.Error when Reply URL is not correctly specifiedPerhaps the following is documented elsewhere but I have not come across it \u2013 a Reply URL can be specified using wildcards!Using wildcard Reply URLs when configuring an AAD appProbably the most common use for this is to end a Reply URL with an asterisk (wildcard) which will permit any URL which begins with the characters preceding it.e.g. https://tenant.sharepoint.com/*This example would support any URL coming from any page in SharePoint Online from within the named tenant.It is also possible to use the wildcard character elsewhere in the Reply URL string.e.g. https://*.sharepoint.com/*This example would support any URL coming from any page in SharePoint Online from within *any* tenant.Armed with this knowledge, be responsible and limit strictly how it is utilised. The implementation of Reply URL is a security feature and it is important that only trusted locations are allowed to interact with your app. I recommend only using wildcard Reply URLs in development environments.Paul.\nActive DirectoryADALAzureAzure ADDeveloperIT ProOffice 365SharePoint Online\nTechnical Tip\nCreating dynamic links to Delve pages\nJune 1, 2016 Paul Ryan Leave a comment\nDelve, as part of the Office 365 suite, provides a number of useful pages for finding content or people that are trending around you or that you recently interacted with. Often, as a Developer, these pages are the perfect target for \u201cSee More\u201d links as part of customisations written using the Office Graph. Or perhaps as an administrator you would like to configure a promoted link on a team site home page to navigate to a user\u2019s \u2018Your Recent Documents\u2019 page in Delve, for example.The Delve Recent Documents page. Note that the URL contains the user\u2019s AAD object ID.Delve Links \u2013 a minor problemWhen you visit pages that show content relevant to a specific user (such as Your Recent Documents or the Recent Documents page for another user) the URL of that page contains a query string variable \u2018u\u2019 with the value of this variable equal to the Azure Active Directory (AAD) object ID of the user. Azure Active Directory is the identity provider that backs Office 365 and is out the scope of this post. If this parameter is not provided then Delve falls back to the Delve homepage. I would have preferred it to have just used the current user if the parameter is not present, but no, this is how it works.So, you can fetch the AAD Object ID by calling into the User Profile Service (Vardhaman Deshpande), however this is not necessary. Delve Links \u2013 an easy resolutionThe \u2018u\u2019 query string parameter can be substituted for the \u2018p\u2019 query string parameter where the value of p is the user\u2019s account name \u2013 the email address which they use to login as. This value is present on any SharePoint 2013+ page via the JavaScript variable: _spPageContextInfo.userLoginNameThis can be utilised as follows:var mySiteHostUrl = \"https://-my.sharepoint.com\";var pageKey = \"liveprofilemodified\"; // liveprofilemodified='Recent Documents', liveprofileworkingwith='People page'var delveUrl = mySiteHostUrl + \"/_layouts/15/me.aspx\" + \"?v=\" + pageKey + \"&p=\" + _spPageContextInfo.userLoginName;Delve Links \u2013 side noteThis value is present as an Office Graph property as: AccountNameThe AAD Object is present as an Office Graph property as: AadObjectIdPaul.\nDelveDeveloperIT ProOffice GraphSharePoint Online\nTechnical Tip\nConvert an existing plain text note field/column to rich text\nApril 22, 2016 Paul Ryan 2 Comments\nIf you create a SharePoint site column (a note field in this case), associate it with a site content type, and then associate that content type with a list in a sub site, the site column will be available on that library. Obviously right?However, when you update the site column (and push all changes to lists and libraries) not *all* of the changes you make are in fact pushed down. An example of this is the setting that dictates whether a note field should allow rich text or enforce plain text. If you change this setting at the site column level it will *not* propagate to libraries which already exist. New instances of the column (say if you associated the content type with a list for the first time) will be configured correctly, but existing list-level instances are not updated. NOTE: This is only true for properties specific to particular column type; common properties such as \u2018required\u2019 will be pushed down to existing instances of the column at the list level.Configuring a SharePoint note fieldSo you want to change a list-level instance of a plain text note column to a rich text note column (or vice-versa, or otherwise change column specific properties or another field type)? You need to do it for every list where the column is in use. That would be very tedious to do via the SharePoint UI, but you can\u2019t anyway. The UI only supports changing the set of common field properties (type, required, hidden, etc).In comes PowerShell. Below you will find a script which updates a plain text note column to be a rich text note column. It is important to note that this script only updates the list-level columns and not the site column. This means that after running the script, new instances will continue to inherit the site column configuration.The script takes advantage of recursion using delegate functions which is an approach I blogged about here: PowerShell Recursion with Delegate FunctionsCredit also to Chris O\u2019Brien\u2019s topofscript.ps1 for the CSOM integration bit: Using CSOM in PowerShell scripts with Office 365The script is written for SharePoint Online (and assumes that the SharePoint Online Client Components SDK is installed) but for this to work on-premises you would only need to update the referenced assemblies (v15 for 2013) and modify the code which passes the credentials. # Parameters$siteCollectionUrl = \"https://<tenant>.sharepoint.com/sites/<site collection>\" # UPDATE$username = \"<username>\" # UPDATE$listTitle = \"Pages\" # UPDATE$fieldName = \"Comments\" # UPDATE# From here on, errors should stop the script$ErrorActionPreference = \"stop\"# Utility functionfunction foreachDecendentWeb(\n[Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]\n[Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.Web]$web,\n[Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]\n[Action[Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.Web]]$webAction){\n# Load child webs\n$context = $web.Context\n$childWebs = $web.Webs\n$context.Load($childWebs)\n$context.ExecuteQuery()\n# Iterate child webs\nforeach($childWeb in $childWebs)\n{\n# Perform action on child web\n$webAction.Invoke($childWeb)\n# Iterate child-child webs\nforeachDecendentWeb $childWeb $webAction\n}}function Prompt-Password ($username) {\n[string]$password = read-host \"Provide password for $username\"\nif($password.length -lt 1) {\nLogError \"You must provide a password\"\nExit\n}\nreturn $password}# Work to be done at each web[Action[Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.Web]]$updateListField = {\nparam([Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]$web)\nwrite-host \"\"\nwrite-host \"Found web: \" -nonewline\nwrite-host \"$($web.Title)\" -f green\n# Fetch list fields\nwrite-host \"Fetching list fields...\"\n$list = $web.Lists.GetByTitle($listTitle)\n$fields = $list.Fields\n$ctx.Load($fields)\n$ctx.ExecuteQuery()\n# Find specific field\nwrite-host \"Finding field...\"\n$field = $fields | ?{$_.InternalName -eq $fieldName}\n# Update field properties\nwrite-host \"Updating field properties...\"\n$field.set_RichText($true)\n$field.set_RestrictedMode($false)\n$field.set_AllowHyperlink($true)\n$field.Update()\n$ctx.Load($field)\n$ctx.ExecuteQuery()\nwrite-host \"Done!\"}write-host \"*Script: Update site description field to support rich text*\"write-host \"Site collection: $siteCollectionUrl\" -f green[string]$password = Prompt-Password $username# Import CSOM assemblieswrite-host \"Importing CSOM assemblies...\"Add-Type -Path \"c:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\microsoft shared\\Web Server Extensions\\16\\ISAPI\\Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.dll\" Add-Type -Path \"c:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\microsoft shared\\Web Server Extensions\\16\\ISAPI\\Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.Runtime.dll\" # Authenticatewrite-host \"Authenticating to SharePoint Online...\"$ctx = New-Object Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.ClientContext($siteCollectionUrl)$securePassword = ConvertTo-SecureString $password -AsPlainText -Force$credentials = New-Object Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.SharePointOnlineCredentials($username, $securePassword) $ctx.Credentials = $credentials# Perform action on root web$rootWeb = $ctx.Web$ctx.Load($rootWeb)$ctx.ExecuteQuery()$updateListField.Invoke($rootWeb)# Perform action on every descendent webforeachDecendentWeb $rootWeb $updateListFieldwrite-host \"\"write-host \"All done!\" -f greenPaul.\nDeveloperIT ProPowershellProgrammaticSharePoint Online\nTechnical Tip\n\u201cSafeQueryPropertiesTemplateUrl\u201d error when calling the SharePoint _api\nApril 20, 2016 Paul Ryan 1 Comment\nIf you call the SharePoint 2013 REST API in your applications ensure that any requests originating from the client are sent from the current web base URL to avoid returning a SafeQueryPropertiesTemplateUrl error.If the current site ishttps://tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/mysitecollection/subsite1/subsite2 then it is very important that you submit API requests ashttps://tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/mysitecollection/subsite1/subsite2/_apiand NOT as any of: https://tenant.sharepoint.com/_api or https://tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/mysitecollection/_api or even https://tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/mysitecollection/subsite1/_apiThe reason for this is that the current user must have access to the site addressed by the base URL of the API request (the bit before the _api). If the user cannot access this site then the request will fail. Unfortunately it doesn\u2019t fail in the manner you might expect (i.e. a 401 access denied exception). A request that fails in this manner will return a 500 error.

She is a villain who attempted to take over Barkingburg in the Mission PAW subseries of PAW Patrol.Sweetie is shown to be antagonistic and sneaky. She tends to fake being nice when around the princess and earl. She doesn't appear to be afraid of the PAW Patrol, as she has invited them to \"catch\" her after stealing the Barkingburg royal crown. When Sweetie laughs, it ends with a snort. She also uses her cuteness to trick the princess and the Earl of Barkingburg into thinking that Chase stole the crown, after she was caught red handed by him and she trapped him into the castle basement. The Princess and Earl were none the wiser and didn't hesitate to believe her lies. The Princess then 'crowned' Sweetie the Queen, thinking Sweetie was just pretending and let her wear it as reward, for 'saving' the crown from Chase. Sweetie then ordered the butler to get her one hundred hamburgers and bones, as she lazed about on the throne. However, her reign was short lived, when to her shock, the PAW Patrol rescued Chase and exposed her plan to the Princess and Earl, thanks to Chase's bow pup tag recording hers and Chase's conversation. The Princess soon demanded that Sweetie returned the crown, but Sweetie mockingly told her and the PAW Patrol that they have to catch her first and she made a run for it. She soon got into a FI race car like vehicle with Ryder, Zuma and Skye on her tail. When she found out, her car turned into a chopper and tried to fly away, but Skye followed after her. Sweetie tried to shake her off by flying upside down, but the crown fell off of her head. Sweetie freed herself from the seatbelt in an attempt to catch the crown, but Skye beat her to it and Sweetie landed on an air bed provided by Chase. In the end, Sweetie was seen in her doghouse, surrounded by golden bars and she began to blame Busby for everything, but she hugged him anyway. She owns a robotic toy frog named Busby and toy kittens that she considers her minions.Sweetie is a smaller puppy (presumably around Skye's size). She has white fur, purple eyes, pink eye shadow on her eyelids, and a dark brown nose. She has pointy triangular ears with fluff on the inside and fluff on each of her cheeks. Her casual outfit is a magenta tiara and a magenta collar with a pink \"crown\" attached to it. The 'crown' acts as a remote control to control Busby and it glows when activated. Her Mission PAW uniform is a black suit with pink and white trim.Read More...Featured Toy (April 2017): Real Talking Tracker plush Tracker\nReleased in 2016.PAW Patrol is on a Roll!

There are also links to ATO government sites on the links page.\nHow many weeks in a year?\nThis calculator adopts the approximation of 52 weeks per year to convert annual to weekly pay. However, there aren't exactly 52 weeks in a year and if you are being paid weekly or fortnightly there will be some years where there maybe 53 or 27 pay days in a year. The actual year depends on which day of the week you are paid.The Gregorian calendar is defined as having exactly 20871 weeks in a 400 year cycle, therefore an average year is exactly 52.1775 weeks long and months average 4.348125 weeks. This is defined in the ISO week-numbering year. These \"leap-weeks\" occur every 5-6 years and \"leap-fortnights\" occur approximately every 11 years. The ATO's tax tables, and most accounting software use a standard 52 weeks per year calculations. In some years a weekly or fortnightly salary earner may need to pay additional income tax for the additional pay they received. The onus is on the employee to make this request, otherwise the 52 weeks per year calculation is made. Because of this anomaly, most employers who define pay on an annual basis adopt the monthly pay cycle.\n\u00a9 2017 robert shearing", "mostFrequentWord": "$xxx", "topic4": 1, "topImportantWord": "TODO!!!!", "id": 226, "topic12": 9}, {"lang": "en", "topic8": 6, "topic2": 1, "url": "http://www.paycheck.in/main", "text": "Paycheck.in\nYou Share, We Compare\nPart of WageIndicator Foundation\nToggle main menu visibility\nSalary\nCost of Living Survey\nEqual Pay Men & Women India\nMinimum Wage Check\nCentral Sphere\nAndaman & Nicobar\nAndhra Pradesh\nArunachal Pradesh\nAssam\nBihar\nChandigarh\nChhattisgarh\nDadra & Nagar Haveli\nDaman & Diu\nDelhi\nGoa\nGujarat\nHaryana\nHimachal Pradesh\nJammu & Kashmir\nJharkhand\nKarnataka\nKerala\nLakshadweep\nMadhya Pradesh\nMaharashtra\nManipur\nMeghalaya\nMizoram\nNagaland\nOrissa\nPuducherry\nPunjab\nRajasthan\nSikkim\nTamil Nadu\nTripura\nUttarakhand\nUttar Pradesh\nWest Bengal\nTelangana\nSalary Checker\nSalary Checker In Hindi\nSalary Survey\nMedia & Journalism - Working Conditions India\nVIP Paycheck - Alphabetical\nAuthors\nCorporate: Bankers\nCorporate: CEOs\nFilm: Actors International\nFilm: Actresses International\nFilm: Bollywood Stars\nFilm: Directors and Producers\nFilm: Game of Thrones Cast\nModels\nMusic: Singers (female)\nMusic: Singers (male)\nPolitics: World Leaders\nPolitics - Chief Ministers India\nRoyal Family Members\nSport: Athletes\nSport: Cricketers India\nSport: Cricketers International\nSport: Footballers\nSport: Formula 1 Race Drivers\nSport: Golfers\nSport: Tennis Players\nWages in Context\nIndia - Living wages\nIndia - Living wages, minimum wages and actual wages\nIndia - Living wages and minimum wages\nIndia - National poverty lines\nIndia - World Bank poverty lines\nIndia - Housing, food and transport costs\nIndia - Consumer prices for food\nLabour Law\nAmendments And Notifications\nConditions Of Service\nWorldstandard\nAnnual Leave and Holidays\nLeave Policy\nSick Leave\nEarned/Casual Leave\nNational Holiday\nAnnual Leave FAQs\nCompensation\nTravel Reimbursement\nEmployment Security\nNotice and Severance\nDomestic Work\nDomestic Work Worldwide\nFair Treatment\nChild Labour\nMinors and Youth\nForced Labour\nSexual Harassment\nProperty Rights\nFamily Responsibilities\nHealth and Safety\nHeath & Safety FAQs\nOccupational Hazards FAQs\nMaternity and Work\nBreastfeeding\nHome-based work in India\nHome-based Work Worldwide\nJob Protection\nMaternity and Work FAQs\nMaternity Benefits\nMaternity Leave\nMaternity Rights\nSick Leave\nWork and Injury Benefits\nDisability and Work Injury FAQs\nSickness and Injury Benefits Worldwide FAQs\nSocial Security\nEmployees State Insurance\nGratuity Benefits\nRetirement Benefits\nUnemployment Benefits\nProvident Fund\nPension Policy\nLegislation News\nTrade Unions\nLegal Compliance\nWork and Wages\nBonus Payment\nPay and Minimum Wages\nPayment of Wages Act\nSalary/Wages\nWork Hours\nWork Hours & Overtime Worldwide FAQs\nWorld Map Labour Laws\nCareer Tips\nRole & Pay\nFresher Paycheck\nResearch & Publication\nWomen Paycheck\nWomen Legislations\nJob Outlook\nWomen: How to apply for a job?\nSalary Survey\nTake our unique Salary Survey and find out about wages in India.\nSalary Survey\nTake our Salary Survey and find out Real Wages\nSalary Check: Are you earning the correct wage?\nHow much is your Cost of Living?\nPrevious\nNext\nWage Comparison\nCompare the wages of white collar workers around the globe with our special section on wages and workAre you earning the right salary for the right work you do?

The Department of Labor filed this week its official Notice of Appeal.The new legislation would provide\u00a0overtime pay to more than 4 million low paid managers, who currently don't qualify for that. At the moment, under the FLSA, if an employee makes at least $23,660 per year - or $455 per week - their employer doesn't have to pay them overtime. The new policy would raise that bar to $47,476 annually or $913 per week for a full time worker.\u00a0As a result of the court's ruling, this new salary threshold will not become effective on December 1, 2016.

I'm not even talking about this room transformation yet (we'll get there) I'm talking about the fact I'm sharing a \"reveal\" of the massive-forever-ongoing-never-ending-PBJreno!!!I wasn't expecting to show the dining room before the kitchen, but this space is fairly complete and I NEED to show you guys because you deserve to see some progress!Here you are, our dining room! \u00a0It underwent a BIG transformation, so here's a quick reminder of the beginning (as it's been a year since you all have seen it).Originally this space wasn't used as the dining room. \u00a0Honestly, I think they used it as complete wasted space. It's right off the kitchen and on the far wall was their kitchen pantry. They had a traditional 6' sliding patio door, with lots of wood paneling and complete with dated fake brick wall.We knew right away what we needed to do:Rip up the floorReplace and expand patio doorBreak down pantry, and reframe into door to access to the garageBEAUTIFY EVERYTHINGFirst began the demo:We knocked out the exterior wall due to dry rot we found, plus had to replace the header and expand the opening for the new 9' patio door we were putting in.Then we ended up knocking down the wall that blocked this space to the kitchen, remove the column, put in a expanding header to open the space up. \u00a0We also knocked down the pantry they had and framed in an interior door access to the garage and a little drop zone/entryway area.Then came time to bulk up the beams, add sheet rock and paint everything a bright beautiful white.You can already see it coming together can't you!Next up was painting the brick wall white too.During all this we also ripped up the flooring, releveled the entire floor (thanks 50's home builders, who needed to use levels anyways), and installed new floors.^ I'm sealing the subfloor to prep it for installing grates on the part of the floor that downslopes.The floors sloped downward from the exterior wall inward. \u00a0We installed metal grates, and then poured leveling concrete over the entire floor to even it out. \u00a0The purpose of the grates are to collect the leveling concrete easier to build it up even with the rest of the floor.Next we just installed laminate wood floor in this area. \u00a0We decided to use laminate as it was durable enough for this space (dining room chairs, traffic in and out of the patio and garage access, kid toys, etc) but inexpensive enough we didn't want to invest a lot of money at this time when we have a ton of other to do in our home. Then it was time to paint, fill with decor, and find a table that fit the space.Dinner is served.Do you just love it? We love it.This is a pretty impromptu reveal, so I hope to share this space as you can see it from our kitchen soon. \u00a0It's an open space from the kitchen, and a custom breakfast bar we built to create one large flowing area.It's so open. It's gets so much beautiful sunlight. And I just CANNOT get enough of how much I LOVE the ceiling and brick wall now... the major change a little TLC and paint can do!Okay one more good ol' BEFORE and AFTER <goosebumps>Can you believe the difference in the ceiling? \u00a0Bulking up the beams, adding trim, and a few coats of white paint TRANSFORMED it. I LOVE it and love the custom look and feel of it!Now I'm all revved up to show you a few more changes we've made throughout the home.\u00a0 We still have LIGHTYEARS until we're done. It's a major work in progress... and I mean it.\u00a0 We literally are always in the middle of a project (as I'm staring at an completely opened/exposed wall in our living room).Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookPosted byPamela Stephensat8:00 AM3commentsLabels:#pbjreno\n,\nbefore and afters\n,\nbefore shots\n,\ndining room\n,\ndiy projects\n,\nhouse tour\n,\nprogress\n,\nrenovation\n,\nreveals\n,\nroom makeover\nThursday, May 14, 2015\n#TBT to the #PBJreno yard You all have seen our house and all the work that needs to be done... but I haven't ever shared the outside, lawn and the current \"yardscaping\".Let me tell you, it's NO better than the inside. \u00a0The yard is a mess. \u00a0And I have no clue how we're going to bring it around. These were from last year, but we didn't make any improvements so it's still looking the same come this Spring. Above is a shot of part of the front yard \"garden\".We have a ton of Basswood trees in our yard and they're terrible. They have really weak trunks as they age and are prone to leaning and their roots coming up front the ground, and eventually breaking from the pressure. \u00a0Awesome right.This is in the backyard on the north side of the yard. \u00a0You can see the mature Basswoods beginning to lean... we have to keep a close eye on those as they're leaning right over our house. \u00a0No big deal right? ... Oh and the garden area above is... I have no clue. Not sure what's in there....Now here's where it becomes a true disaster... behind those trees is this weird left over structure that maybe at one point was a jungle set? Honestly, no clue.And right next to that is an actual jungle set... that we don't let our kids go near.Oh and our lovely previous owners left lots of random garbage and old toys for us too... as you can see the awesome trampoline in the background too.Here's another nice shot of one of our gardens.... beautiful right?\u00a0This one part \u00a0has changed... we ripped down the three season porch when we demo'd the kitchen a year ago. \u00a0The footers were completely rotted out so we knew it had to be removed. \u00a0When we had the dumpster we just thought why not.We have no clue what we're doing in our yard... so that'll be interesting year over year trying to fix it up as we're renovating the inside.Were we just insane to buy this house or what?Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookPosted byPamela Stephensat8:30 AM\n1\ncommentsLabels:#pbjreno\n,\ncurb appeal\n,\nyard progress\n,\nyardwork\nMonday, May 11, 2015\nOur DIY Open Kitchen Shelves | #PBJrenooh, hey there!Yes, I'm still alive. \u00a0And I've decided I REALLY need to get back on this... so plan on some awesome updates of the #PBJrenoSeriously though... a whole house renovation DIY style takes so much time and energy, plus my \"new\" job (I say \"new\" because I started it in August, but it's the reason why the blog has gone... zzzzz, long commute, busy days... I'm pooped after it all)Okay, let's get back to the juicy stuff. OUR HOUSE! So we've tackled the kitchen/dining room. \u00a0We have a FEW minor projects I've been ... 'tackling' for about 8 months now (seriously) being the cause of why this room hasn't had a full reveal yet. But if you follow me on FB & IG you definitely have seen enough to know what we've done to transform this space.Now let's talk specifics, I knew the moment I walked into this space I wanted open shelves... and once we started quoting cabinet costs I REALLY knew we'd do open shelves. The layout in the kitchen allows for quite a lot of cabinets, and as a family of four coming from a previous kitchen layout that had a ton (TON) of kitchen storage space I knew we had to be functional with the layout.With all the necessity for cabinets, our costs increased super quickly. So, it was the perfect solution to this wall that had all upper cabinets and lower cabinets to break it up with open shelves.And of course, why buy when you can DIY!That's the before, before we built the shelves, before I replaced the broken pendant light and before I finished the top of cabinet molding. \u00a0Hey at least I had installed the hardware at this point. (seriously 1 project no matter how minor still takes like 5 months to finish around here) \u00a0What's so great about this is this is the focal point when you walk in the kitchen. \u00a0It's dead-ahead and I love that we broke up the upper cabinets with the idea of open shelves.So of course I go to my go-to girls for ideas how to build the best floating shelves, Shanty2Chic gals. Their plans were the perfect foundation to my plan... which is always best. \u00a0Try to make every project you do your own in some small way. \u00a0Adapt a template, add a step, change the color - something, do something to personalize any DIY tutorial.Above are the \"guts\" of the floating shelves. \u00a0The goods that you need to make the skeleton that lives inside the shelves.\u00a0Then you grab your Kreg Jig (why YES I am using our dining room table as my work table... normally I'd NEVER suggest doing that. But (1) I know 100% we're killing that table ASAP so who cares and (2) our garage was freezing in the middle of the winter at this point so I prefer the warmth.Back to the project - I really didn't plan on doing a step-by-step tutorial, but Shanty-2-Chic gals have a great tutorial anyways... so mine's just for context. \u00a0For the inner guts you want to make these \"E\" shape brackets. \u00a0I say \"E\" shaped, because I was super nervous about only putting one middle support bracket in this shape so I added an extra middles support bar to make an \"M\" shape. \u00a0(Original tutorial suggested just one support piece).\u00a0Once the support pieces are made you'll need to attach them to the wall and it's best to find the studs and attach directly to those. \u00a0When you're drilling directly into tile you want to be sure you are using the proper drill bit. \u00a0This one is made specifically made for tile/porcelain so it helps reduce the risk of breaking the tile. To reduce the amount of splintering, a quick tip is to use painter's tape directly over the hole too. Initially I used 3\" screws and installed the brackets but could feel slight slag to them so took them down and used 4\" screws. \u00a0I really wanted to be better safe than sorry. Once you attached the support structure, you can just attach the cover boards. I just attached one 1x10\" on top, 1/2\"x10\" sanded plywood on the bottom, and then a 1x4 on the front to cover all front facing boards. Initially I was going to make the shelves the same thickness, but once I installed it the bottom shelf seemed underwhelming. \u00a0I ended up changing the dimensions of the bottom bracket to make it 4\" thick while the top one is 3\".\u00a0Then just stain, seal, and decorate. There you go, OPEN KITCHEN SHELVES!Per usual, I used Minwax Provencial Stain - it's my go-to stain for any wood project. \u00a0It finishes SO beautifully, accepts the flaws in wood, accents the wood grain and smooths the final finish.Way too happy we have this space for decor and useful space now.What do you think? Would you give up truly functional space in your kitchen for open shelves?Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookPosted byPBJstoriesat8:00 AM7commentsLabels:#pbjreno\n,\ndecorating\n,\ndiy projects\n,\nfloating shelves\n,\nkitchen\n,\nrenovation\n,\ntutorials\nOlder PostsHomeSubscribe to:Posts\n(\nAtom\n)\n.Kitchen Pantry Reveal !\nI {finally} completed my pantry makeover!\nI mentioned in June {wow it took me a while to finish this} that I was going to redo my ...My Hide-Away Printer Project\nYou\u2019ve already seen my filing trunk\nthat I revealed last week which helped with papers and organizing for my desk area.\u00a0 Now I am excited...How to make a Custom Built Baby Gate | DIY Project\nThis was one of the first big projects I\u2019ve done where I created my own plans for it, measurements, details, and then executed it and had ...Master Bedroom DIY Projects and Shopping ListI am so honored and grateful for all the amazing comments and feedback I\u2019ve received from my Master Bedroom Reveal .\u00a0 You guys are AMAZING!\u00a0...Come see the little side project I'm working on!\nWe have a little secret to share....\nand Jackson wants to share it....\nEdited to add:\nYou guys are fabulous and I am so ...\n\u25bc\n2015\n(\n7\n)\n\u25bc\nJune\n(\n1\n)\nOur little Dining Room Makeover | PBJreno\n\u25ba\nMay\n(\n2\n)\n\u25ba\nFebruary\n(\n2\n)\n\u25ba\nJanuary\n(\n2\n)\n\u25ba\n2014\n(\n35\n)\n\u25ba\nDecember\n(\n1\n)\n\u25ba\nOctober\n(\n4\n)\n\u25ba\nSeptember\n(\n4\n)\n\u25ba\nAugust\n(\n2\n)\n\u25ba\nJuly\n(\n2\n)\n\u25ba\nJune\n(\n4\n)\n\u25ba\nMay\n(\n4\n)\n\u25ba\nApril\n(\n2\n)\n\u25ba\nMarch\n(\n1\n)\n\u25ba\nFebruary\n(\n6\n)\n\u25ba\nJanuary\n(\n5\n)\n\u25ba\n2013\n(\n51\n)\n\u25ba\nDecember\n(\n6\n)\n\u25ba\nNovember\n(\n3\n)\n\u25ba\nOctober\n(\n5\n)\n\u25ba\nSeptember\n(\n4\n)\n\u25ba\nAugust\n(\n2\n)\n\u25ba\nJuly\n(\n5\n)\n\u25ba\nJune\n(\n4\n)\n\u25ba\nMay\n(\n4\n)\n\u25ba\nApril\n(\n6\n)\n\u25ba\nMarch\n(\n2\n)\n\u25ba\nFebruary\n(\n5\n)\n\u25ba\nJanuary\n(\n5\n)\n\u25ba\n2012\n(\n117\n)\n\u25ba\nDecember\n(\n6\n)\n\u25ba\nNovember\n(\n8\n)\n\u25ba\nOctober\n(\n8\n)\n\u25ba\nSeptember\n(\n5\n)\n\u25ba\nAugust\n(\n8\n)\n\u25ba\nJuly\n(\n7\n)\n\u25ba\nJune\n(\n12\n)\n\u25ba\nMay\n(\n19\n)\n\u25ba\nApril\n(\n14\n)\n\u25ba\nMarch\n(\n9\n)\n\u25ba\nFebruary\n(\n9\n)\n\u25ba\nJanuary\n(\n12\n)\n\u25ba\n2011\n(\n119\n)\n\u25ba\nDecember\n(\n13\n)\n\u25ba\nNovember\n(\n16\n)\n\u25ba\nOctober\n(\n12\n)\n\u25ba\nSeptember\n(\n11\n)\n\u25ba\nAugust\n(\n16\n)\n\u25ba\nJuly\n(\n8\n)\n\u25ba\nJune\n(\n20\n)\n\u25ba\nMay\n(\n23\n)\nCopyright \u00a9 Pamela Stephens and PB&Jstories, 2012.\nUnauthorized use and/or duplication of this material not limited to images, words, or descriptions, without express and\nwritten permission from this blog\u2019s author and/or owner is strictly\nprohibited.

Catching up? Check out yesterday\u2019s blog post: Outer Banks Family Vacation (Day One)Outer Banks Family Vacation: Day TwoThe second day of our family vacation to the Outer Banks of North Carolina kicked off in a very active way! Our family created a private Facebook group to help with the planning of our big weekend getaway and when someone proposed running in the First Flight 5K race (part of the Flying Pirate Half Marathon Weekend that coincided with our trip), a bunch of us (17 in total) jumped at the chance to sneak in a little activity on Saturday morning and registered to participate in the run.We set our alarms for an hour before the race, downed coffee and toasted bagels and walked about half of a mile from our rental house to the race start at the Wright Brothers National Memorial.First Flight 5K The race began promptly at 7:30 a.m. and our group split up into various corrals depending on our predicted finish times. Ryan and I initially registered to be part of the final corral since we planned to walk the 5K with Chase in our hiking backpack. When my Aunt Laurie enthusiastically offered to hang with Chase at home since she wasn\u2019t planning to participate, we took her up on her kind offer and were excited to be able to in our first race since Chase was born!Right before the gun went off to begin the race, the coffee I drank first thing in the morning hit me, and I was actually in a port-a-potty as everyone began running! Thankfully I was able to connect with my mom, dad and sister in the final corral and cross through the start line about 10 minutes after the gun went off.Since I didn\u2019t plan on running, I didn\u2019t bring my earphones or a running watch with me to the Outer Banks, so I ended up running the race technology-free which was actually really, really nice!Since I haven\u2019t done a 5K in years and most of my running is interval-based rather than a steady state run, I had no idea what to anticipate for my time. The course also didn\u2019t have clocks with mile times at the various mile markers which made me focus more on running at a pace that felt good to me and my body. The course took us around the Wright Brothers National Memorial two times which was great since it allowed me to wave and high five various members of my family as we passed each other along the course. Looking for the 16 other runners from our group as I ran made the race so much fun!!!I crossed the finish line with an unofficial time of around 27 minutes and felt great! Finishing the 5K made me remember just how much I used to love running in races and made me feel a little bit of that running itch again. I love my current workouts so much but I\u2019ve always said there\u2019s nothing quite as satisfying as the way I feel after a great run. It\u2019s a different kind of feeling than the feeling I get from other workouts and I think it stems from the fact that I have never felt like I am a naturally good runner. No matter how slow I run or jog, I still feel like running is challenging for me but it\u2019s also the workout that feels the most like an escape for me both mentally and physically.Once I was done running, I collected my medal, downed a bottle of water and hooked back up with the group of our family members who finished before me. Since a few members from my family were walking the race, a handful of us were able to loop back up with them and walk the last mile together which was really fun! We peeled off before the finish so they could walk through the finish together and collect their medals!We hung out at the race for a bit so Bob (my mom\u2019s cousin\u2019s husband) could collect a medal for placing third in his age group and walked over to the results tent to check our official times as we waited. Three of us had issues with our times (apparently our chips didn\u2019t register as we crossed the finish and mine was never scanned) so we didn\u2019t get an official race time which was a bummer but none of us cared enough to wait in the long line of people who also seemed to have time-related issues. We decided to stretch in the grass and play airplane instead. Priorities!Saturday Afternoon + EveningWe cheered for Bob as he received his medal before walking back to the house to eat a big breakfast! I made a frittata for the group and we all filled our plates with homemade granola (I NEED to get Jennie\u2019s recipe to share with you guys!), yogurt, scrambled eggs, frittata and fruit.Next up on our agenda was beach time!! We covered our bodies in sunscreen, changed into swimsuits and headed outside for a few hours of beach fun, including bocce ball and spike ball, a new-to-me game that was a HUGE hit with our group.Once Chase was ready for his nap, I headed back to the house with him and spent the rest of his naptime at the pool. Everyone else seemed ready for swimming around the same time and we had an absolute blast playing pool games and judging each other\u2019s splashes in a giant cannonball contest.When I looked at the time and realized Chase would likely be waking up soon, I hopped in the shower to freshen up before a small group of us went to get some ice cream and play at the local children\u2019s museum next door.The museum was the perfect size for a kid Chase\u2019s age \u2013 small enough to feel contained but big enough for him to run around and have fun. To be honest, I\u2019m not sure who had more fun at the museum, Chase or me and Ryan! We discovered an indo board and Ryan and I had a great time gliding on it while Chase played. Ryan used to have an indo board at his apartment in college and it took us waaaay back!We popped into Big Buck\u2019s for ice cream before heading back to the house to get ready for a big family picture we had on the agenda!My mom\u2019s cousin Jennie suggested getting all of us together for a family photo during the trip since her daughter-in-law, Amy, is a professional photographer in Raleigh and volunteered to snap a few photos of our gang!We headed out to the beach around 6 p.m. for photos and I cannot wait to see Amy\u2019s pictures once she has a chance to comb through all of them. Here\u2019s one of the whole gang she sent us as a preview:I kind of anticipated such a large group photo being rather stressful (especially with Chase in the mix) but I think Chase actually helped keep things really light hearted with high-fives in between photo snaps and lots of ridiculous cheering. We laughed a lot during the photos and it was a blast! I\u2019ll be sure to share some more from Amy once she passes them along.(My sister quickly snapped the above pic of our trio as everyone else was heading out to the beach. Thanks Les!)After our photo session, we all walked back to the house and promptly changed into comfy clothes! We spent the rest of our final night together sipping on drinks in the adorable glasses Alison made for everyone while we ate dinner and played numerous rounds of Head\u2019s Up using an app on my phone.As we left the Outer Banks early on Sunday morning, the rain began to pour and we felt awfully thankful that our trip was filled with sunshine! I feel like we just began to scratch the surface when it come to exploring everything the Outer Banks has to offer. We truly had an incredible time with our family during our short weekend getaway and I really, really hope a trip like this becomes an annual event!Filed Under: Family, Travel Tagged With: 5k, 5k race, beach, family, Kill Devil Hills, Outer Banks, race, race recapOuter Banks Family Vacation: Day One April 24, 2017 by Julie 38 Comments Good morning!

The Clippers never led again after controlling the game for most of the night.Rodney Hood and Joe Ingles also hit huge baskets for Utah down the stretch. The Jazz needed all the help they could get after Gordon Hayward left with food poisoning.\nFred Hoiberg: 'Impossible to guard' Isaiah Thomas when he travels\n(April 24, 2017)Nick Friedell [ Source: ESPN ]\nCHICAGO -- After watching Boston Celtics guard Isaiah Thomas dominate his team to the tune of 33 points in a 104-95 Game 4 loss on Sunday night, the frustration that has been building up inside of Chicago Bulls head coach Fred Hoiberg finally boiled over. Hoiberg believes that Thomas has been carrying the ball at various points through the series and is upset about how the All-Star point guard is being officiated.\"Let me say this, Isaiah Thomas is a hell of a player,\" Hoiberg began. \"An unbelievable competitor -- he's a warrior, everything he's going through right now. He had a hell of a game tonight. But when you're allowed to discontinue your dribble on every possession, he is impossible to guard. He's impossible to guard when you're able to put your hand underneath the ball and take two or three steps and put it back down. It's impossible to guard him in those situations.\"Hoiberg said he has been talking to officials throughout the series, telling them that he feels Thomas is carrying the ball. Hoiberg said he has been told by the officials that they would watch for the violation.\nThomas scores 33, Celtics beat Bulls 104-95 to tie series\n(April 24, 2017)Associated Press [ Source: ESPN ]\nCHICAGO -- Isaiah Thomas is playing through tears after the death of his sister, drawing strength from the rest of the Boston Celtics.They found another gear in Chicago.Thomas scored 33 points, and the Celtics beat the Bulls 104-95 on Sunday to tie their first-round playoff series at 2-all.\nRussell Westbrook defends Thunder teammates: 'Don't try to split us up'\n(April 24, 2017)Associated Press [ Source: ESPN ]\nOKLAHOMA CITY -- Thunder guard Russell Westbrook went on a rant defending his teammates after Sunday's 113-109 loss to the Houston Rockets in Game 4 of the first round of the NBA playoffs.A recurring theme throughout the series has been Oklahoma City's tendency to lose leads when Westbrook sits in the second half. It happened again on Sunday, as the Thunder were outscored 13-4 in a stretch that lasted from late in the third quarter to early in the fourth. The lapse turned a 75-68 lead into an 81-79 deficit.Thunder center Steven Adams was asked about the issue, and Westbrook interrupted.\nNene's 28 lead Rockets past Thunder for 3-1 series lead\n(April 24, 2017)Associated Press [ Source: ESPN ]\nOKLAHOMA CITY -- James Harden's shot was off, and one of the most unlikely players on Houston's roster came to the rescue.Nene scored 28 points on perfect shooting from the field, and the Rockets beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 113-109 on Sunday to take a 3-1 lead in their first-round playoff series.The 6-foot-11 center from Brazil made all 12 of his shots and had 10 rebounds. It was an impressive performance from a reserve who averaged about nine points per game in the regular season.\nJames leads yet another team to a first-round sweep\n(April 24, 2017)Dave McMenamin [ Source: ESPN ]\nINDIANAPOLIS -- It could have been any conversation between any mother and son leaving a crowded live sporting event.The mother wanted to walk back to the hotel alone. It wasn't too far from the arena, she reasoned. The son didn't think it was a good idea. The mother countered by saying she could just hail a cab. The son said that with the game getting out, traffic would be congested and why not walk because it will be faster, just walk with someone. The son suggested a business associate accompany the mother, and the problem was solved.A perfectly normal conversation between LeBron and Gloria James after the Cleveland Cavaliers superstar turned in another playoff performance in sweeping the Indiana Pacers that is making his masterpieces seem mundane.\nJames helps Cavs hold off Pacers, earn sweep into 2nd round\n(April 24, 2017)Associated Press [ Source: ESPN ]\nINDIANAPOLIS -- LeBron James stuck to the old script Sunday.Again, he bailed out the Cleveland Cavaliers. And again, he sent the Indiana Pacers home for vacation.On yet another milestone day for basketball's king, James' crowning achievement was making the go-ahead 3-pointer with 1:08 to play and helping the defending champions hold on for a series-clinching 106-102 victory at Indiana.\nAguilar\u2019s defensive effort earns Cone\u2019s praise\n(April 24, 2017)Randolph B. Leongson [ Source: Inquirer ]\nWith TNT controlling the tempo of the game in the first half, Ginebra coach Tim Cone told his wards at halftime that the Gin Kings must pick up the pace on defense if they want to grab the victory.Luckily, Japeth Aguilar heeded the call and held the fort in the paint, allowing the Gin Kings to slowly creep their way back.\u201cJapeth was incredibly active all game long. He\u2019s such an intimidator and great rim protector all game long and I think, that was the key,\u201d Cone said. \u201cIt was really the defensive stand in the third and fourth quarter that really changed the game and Japeth was just all over the place.\u201d\nSymptoms from previous surgeries to keep Warriors' Steve Kerr out\n(April 24, 2017)Chris Haynes [ Source: ESPN ]\nPORTLAND, Ore. -- Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr said Sunday he won't return to the sideline until he can find a remedy for the painful symptoms he's experiencing due to complications from back surgery almost two years ago.He acknowledged this could keep him out the remainder of the playoffs.\"This is not going to be a case where I'm coaching one night and not coaching the next,\" Kerr said. \"I'm not going to do that to our team, to our staff. We're hoping that over the next week or two, or whatever it is, I can start to make a definitive realization, a reduction, or just feel it that I'm going to do this or not.\"\nPumaren lauds ailing Romeo for showing up in GlobalPort's lopsided win vs Mahindra\n(April 24, 2017)Denison Rey A. Dalupang [ Source: Philippine Star ]\nMANILA, Philippines \u2013 Franz Pumaren could've raved about the second win that temporarily stopped GlobalPort's bleeding in the 2017 PBA Commissioner's Cup.But he spent much of his post-game presser lauding his prized guard, Terrence Romeo.\"That's what we've been hoping--that our bench would contribute,\" Pumaren told the press after a 105-86 demolition of Mahindra on Sunday.\nPBA\nNBA\nBasketball\nBoxing\nTennis\nGolf\nChess\nFootball\nBilliards\nFormula One\nVolleyball\nSEA Games\nOlympics\nOther Sports\n2016-2017 Commissioner's Cup Eliminations\nTeam W L PCT\nSan Miguel\n4 0 1.000\nMeralco\n6 1 0.833\nBarangay Ginebra\n4 1 0.800\nStar\n5 2 0.714\nTNT\n5 2 0.714\nAlaska\n4 2 0.667\nRain or Shine\n4 2 0.667\nPhoenix\n3 4 0.429\nGlobalport\n2 5 0.286\nBlackwater Elite\n1 6 0.143\nMahindra\n1 6 0.143\nNLEX\n0 7 0.000\nTerms and Conditions ::\nPrivacy Policy Disclaimer: pba-online.net does not own any information, news and/or images featured on this site unless otherwise noted.

It has a series of seemingly sophisticated tools but you do not have to use them. You may use the simple (un-advanced) tools to make quick edits. If you are looking for a deeper and more complete image enhancement then you may open up the advanced tools and toggle with the sliders to improve the image. This tool is not a photoshopping program it is an image-editing program that also has excellent scanner support. The tool has an interface that is similar to Microsoft Paint but is a little more polished and advanced.\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\tConclusion - A Good Option If You Are Shopping For Free Editors\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\tThe PC Image Editor is a free editor that is not trying to pass itself off as a photoshopping program. It is a fast and efficient editing tool for people that are not looking for sophisticated edits. The tool allows for slightly deeper edits than one usually expects from free tools which is a bonus!\nAuthor's review\nThe PC Image Editor is designed to be easy to use and user friendly.

Take a quick test to decide which computer is better for you.\nQuestion 1: Are you a gaming fanatic?\nYes\nNo\nMac vs PC comparison with a test A PC or a Mac, which should I get? Will I buy a new Macbook or Windows laptop? Which is best for me? Similar question, which operating system is better: Windows vs Os. When buying a new computer your main comparison will be between these two options, which we will break down for you: Apple Macintosh, or \u201cMac\u201d: Apple Macbook if you\u2019re looking for a laptop, or maybe even a Macbook Pro. The iMac is the Apple desktop computer. Both Macbook and iMac run with the operating system Mac OS X (as opposed to iOS that is a smartphone/ tablet OS). versus ...\nWindows PC: Laptops and desktops running on Windows, Microsoft's operating system. Made by brands like Acer, Asus, Dell, HP and Lenovo\u2026 and many others. The brand diversity makes it harder to compare the hardware. But the software these computers run of is 99% Windows. Mac vs pc is subject of great discussion. And you will be sure to find many sources and reviews on the web. Many experts publish about this comparison discussing which exact Macbook types are available, their respective differences and how they compare with HP and Lenevo laptops. For laptops there's a wide range, but also for desktops many options are available for Windows desktops versus iMac.\t\t\tOur PC vs Mac test is an alternative that consists of 8 simple questions and takes just 2 minutes to complete. It gives you a personal answer if Mac or PC is better. Start test right away on top of this page. Is Mac better than PC, and why? (And vice versa.) The comparison covers aspects like purpose for professional and recreational use of the computer. E.g. relevant if you\u2019re considering to buy a macbook pro because you\u2019re a designer. As a gamer you\u2019ll have different requirements. Design and usability demands are taken into account, as well buying decision criteria like computer cost, maintainance and service. Which smartphone and brand ecosystem you prefer can be influencial in this comparison. Also your personal beliefs on values like freedom or safety play an important role. Should the software be highly customizable or plug and play? An operating system like Windows has a total different approach than Mac Os when it comes to these criteria. PC vs Mac is a quiz like test has been made simple and short to easely decide which is better for you. However the test result is without any guarantees.

Shortly after the launch of Nvidia\u2019s own GeForce Titan XP (Mk.II), AMD has launched a Polaris 10 based Radeon Pro Duo 32GB graphics card, its highest-end graphics chip yet.If that name rings a bell, that\u2019s because AMD launched a graphics card last year called, yep, you guessed it, the Radeon Pro Duo. At the time it was the fastest gaming graphics card in the world, packing in dual Fiji GPUs; essentially two Radeon R9 Fury X\u2019s in a single graphics card.

Average FPS almost quadrupled when going from Max to Minimum, meaning there's plenty of wiggle room to achieve your desired performance while keeping in line with your own personal visual expectations. That said, Dawn of War 3 isn't exactly a looker at Low settings, so be warned you aren't getting quite the same experience.Here's some Low v Ultra Dawn of War 3 graphics comparison screens so you can make the judgement call for yourself. Also, remember to check out Dawn of War 3's system requirements to get some pointers as to which graphics settings are going to suit your PC hardware.\u00a0 Read More Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War 3 Beta PC Benchmark - MSI GeForce GTX 1060 Gaming X 6GBJon Suttonon 24 April 2017 at 12:45Relic's been running the Dawn of War 3 open beta this past weekend, giving RTS fans a sneak peek at the multiplayer offerings. The reaction has been... divisive to say the least. Not many people were prepared to see Dawn of War 3 hurtle down the MOBA route. Anyway, this beta is also serves as a great time to take a look at performance. We're only a matter of days away from its April 27th launch, so this is essentially the finished product.First of all, let's take a look at Dawn of War 3's various graphics options. The graphics settings are a little on the lean side, but there's plenty here that has a big impact on both performance and visual quality. One thing I found particularly neat was the predicted FPS. However, it's worth bearing in mind this number was usually a good 20% higher than the performance I actually achieved in the benchmark tests.

However, we weren\u2019t prepared to hear that just a single person from Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Direct 3D team handled\u00a0porting Forza Motorsport 6: Apex. Matt Lee was the man responsible, and he got Forza 6 running on Scorpio at 4K, 60 frames per second in just two days.According to Chris Tector, Turn 10\u2019s studio software architect, Lee turned up to the studio with a box of gear, went into a room for two days and came out with the finished product.

Ah it's MotoGP 17 time, a chance for us to relive our dreams of mounting 350 pounds of metal, with 250HP tucked between our legs, grazing our knees as we bundle around corners. Few motorbiking games quite nail the feeling like MotoGP, and MotoGP 17 looks to improve on everything that came before, as well as including the full 2017 MotoGP track and rider list. Be warned though, MotoGP 17 is no slouch in the system requirements department.As I said earlier, MotoGP 17 won't give your gaming PC an easy ride. The recommended specs are pretty daunting to say the least, and Milestone reckon you're going to need a pretty decent video card with at least 4GB of VRAM in order to max the settings out. Likewise the CPU pairing is pretty high end; probably a necessity if you want to render all 24 riders at a high level of detail.

After the excruciating torment of getting through Outlast, I'd thought I'd seen the last of its diabolical ways. But alas, it's back and looking more terrifying than ever; a tale of killer villagers, horrendous inbreeding, and some good old fashioned fisticuffs between good and evil. No, I'm not talking about Midsomer Murders, but Outlast 2. It's slicing its way onto PC next week, here are Outlast 2's official PC system requirementsc so you can make sure you're good and ready for the horror show.Fret not, my little horrors, for Outlast 2 is but a breeze to run. In comparison to your average title today at least. If you were hoping for the same specs as the original Outlast, you may be disappoint. Read More Microsoft Avoided Adding an AMD Ryzen CPU to Scorpio in Order to Keep the 4K Console CheapJon Suttonon 18 April 2017 at 14:22Microsoft has explained why Project Scorpio doesn\u2019t feature a custom Ryzen CPU, and the answer is surprisingly simple - AMD Ryzen is too expensive and gamers wouldn\u2019t be prepared to buy a prohibitively pricey console.A lot of the rumours surrounding Project Scorpio before the official specs unveiling centred around a potential 8-core Ryzen CPU. This would\u2019ve absolutely flew, however Microsoft instead decided to opt for a custom 8-core Jaguar CPU clocked at 2.73 GHz. This is an incremental upgrade over the Xbox One, rather than a major evolution. Read More Rumour: Nvidia Has Accelerated Volta GPU Plans, GeForce GTX 2080 to Launch in Q3 2017Stuart Thomason 18 April 2017 at 11:51Nvidia has allegedly accelerated its plans for its next-generation Volta GPUs, planning a full launch in Q3 2017. Previously it was through Nvidia would be opting for a Pascal refresh before jumping into next-gen with its Volta chips, however it\u2019s now being reported Nvidia has changed its plans and will release an entire new series of graphics cards later this year.The GeForce GTX 10 series originally launched with the GeForce GTX 1080 and GeForce GTX 1070 roughly a year ago, so a Volta launch in Q3 2017 would be about an 18-month gap. This fits in with Nvidia\u2019s usual release cadence, however we\u2019re used to seeing minor architectural improvements before totally new generation of GPUs. Read More Microsoft Releasing Halo Wars on Steam This Week - Full System Requirements RevealedJon Suttonon 18 April 2017 at 10:44In a promising indication of Microsoft\u2019s potential future plans, Halo Wars: Definitive Edition is coming to Steam this week. Originally bundled in with Halo Wars 2 as a Windows 10 Store exclusive, Microsoft has loosened the shackles and allowed its most iconic brand onto the Steam store.The very fact this is happening is probably more exciting than the game itself, which is very much a console friendly RTS-lite with basic base-building that calls to mind Command and Conquer 3 & 4. The port shows Microsoft is open to experimenting with Steam, and happy for its games to co-exist on both platforms. It\u2019s still a long way from Gears of War 4 coming to Steam, but it\u2019s looking a whole lot more likely now.

The chargerThe Apple Watch charger is circular contraption the connects magnetically to the back of the watch.\nI like the magnetic part, but I have no idea why they decided to put in on the back of the watch.\nIt would be so much easier if the charger connected to the side.\nInstead of simply placing the watch on the charger, I have to pull both sides of the wristbands taught and meticulously place it on the white circle.\nI do this every night in my dark bedroom and it's annoying.CommentsView Full Article...March 11, 2017Apple Watch Nike+ ReviewI never wanted an Apple Watch.\nI made that pretty clear back in 2014.\nBut my Garmin Forerunner 405CX running watch recently died and I needed a replacement.\nSo I decided to try the Apple Watch.\nI bought the Nike version, a.k.a. the \"Apple Watch Nike+\" model, just after the beginning of the year and I've been using it for about two months.It's a good thing I waited to review the watch until after two months of owning it.\nMy view of the watch has changed a lot since the first week or so.\nLet me explain.I bought the Apple Watch to replace my Garmin Forerunner, not to use as a daily watch.\nThe Apple Watch Series 2 (which the Nike+ version is based on) is the first model to include GPS, so this was the first time I even considered an Apple Watch.\nSince I'm already so deep into the Apple ecosystem, the way the Apple Watch synced with my iPhone made it worth the premium compared to running watches, even if I just used it for running.\nThe $400 price for the 42mm model wasn't much different than the $330 Garmin Forerunner 235.\nApple haters and trolls, your comments are welcome below.When I got the watch, I decided to wear it for a week to test out all the non-running features.\nAfter all, I am still kind of a geek and I wanted to see what the thing could do.\nMy plan was to put it back on the shelf after a week and then just use it for running.\nTwo months later, I'm still wearing the watch.\nIt's become a daily accessory.\nBut that didn't happen without a few notable frustrations.CommentsView Full Article...January 20, 2017Goodbye HTTP, Hello HTTPSOn Wednesday, January 18th, PC.net underwent the biggest change since I renamed the site from Sharpened.net to PC.net on May 1, 2012.\nOnce again the website has a new URL.\nInstead of http://pc.net, the new URL is https://pc.net.\nPretty dramatic, huh?While it is a small change, this means all traffic to PC.net will be handled through the HTTPS protocol instead of boring old HTTP.\nSo what exactly is HTTPS?\nIt is a secure version of HTTP, the standard protocol used for accessing webpages.\nIt runs connections through SSL, which encrypts the communication.\nTherefore, your connection to PC.net will now be encrypted, meaning no one can eavesdrop on your browsing or see what you submit via the contact form, for instance.\nOtherwise, it should have no noticeable effect on your PC.net experience.HTTPS is super important for e-commerce sites and websites where you can log in with a username and password.\nIt protects your personal information from being intercepted by someone on your network running a packet sniffing program or other malicious software.\nFor PC.net, this isn't really a concern.So why the switch?\nWell Google, the self-proclaimed authority of webmaster guidelines for websites around the world, has encouraged websites to use HTTPS since August 6, 2014.\nThe goal, I suppose, is to make the web more secure, preventing data theft and the alteration of webpage content between the server and end user.\nA noble goal, but also a pretty big hassle for the average webmaster.\nHistorically, moving to HTTPS has involved buying a secure certificate, authenticating your identity as an individual or organization, and installing the certificate for your domain on the server.\nNot an easy task for the everyday webmaster.CommentsView Full Article...November 23, 2016Why my Health Insurance Premiums are Increasing 56% Next YearMy health insurance premiums are going up over 56% next year.\nIt is the biggest annual increase in monthly premiums I have ever had \u2013 by far.A few weeks ago, I surmised how Obamacare may have been a pivotal factor in the U.S. election.\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) has driven up health care costs and has actually made health care much less affordable for most US citizens.\nIt certainly has not benefitted me the past few years.\nSee the chart of my 2005 to 2017 insurance premiums below.The chart above speaks for itself.\nAs the details of the Affordable Care Act have been implemented over past few years, I have watched my health insurance premiums skyrocket.\nOn top of that, my insurance company \u2013 Medica \u2013 has reduced my coverage, lowered the amount they will pay for prescription drugs, and increased my deductible.CommentsView Full Article...Previous PC Updates \u2192 -

Providence last played at Mohegan Sun in the 2014-15 season as part of the Hall of Fame Tipoff. The Friars defeated Florida State and Notre Dame to take home the trophy. This game, which Rothstein reported is likely to be part of a double-header, will just be a neutral site game and not part of a tournament. The Friars are playing in the 2017 2K Classic in November.

The recruiting service bumped the rising junior class rankings from a Top 75 to a Top 100 and there proved to be little change in terms of where Providence\u2019s recruits were ranked.

PC Booster 2008 works via an interface that looks something like a virus checker although instead of checking for infections, PC Booster 2008 checks for areas of your system that could do with tightening up.\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\tWhat's nice is that PC Booster 2008 gives you various options such as Optimize, Autotune, Stabilize, Customize and Benchmark your system. So for example, if you've been suffering frequent crashes, you'll want to try and stabilize your machine. If speed has been an issue, optimizing it will be better. It's not entirely clear what the difference is between Autotune and Optimize and PC Booster 2008 developers could probably have combined these two functions into one but wither way, the result is that your system should run faster.\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\tWithin each option in PC Booster 2008, you're given several sub-categories so for example, if you choose Optimize, you are given options for hard disk tweaks, network tweaks, memory tweaks etc. Although this gives you the feeling that you're really getting deep down into your system, I'm still skeptical as to exactly how much difference they really make.\nIf you're looking for a faster, more responsive system or are looking to iron out annoying crashes and system failures, PC Booster 2008 is worth a try.\nAdvertisement\n\u2014 General Optimization \u2014\nTop downloads\nDriverPack Solution Online A one-stop solution?\nIObit Advanced SystemCare The ideal tool for fixing and speeding up Windows\nBaidu PC Faster Optimize and protect your PC with this alternative to TuneUp\nAdvanced SystemCare Advanced SystemCare\nBoost - Speed up your PC Boost helps you gain back control of your PC.\nMore\nLatest apps\nAdvanced SystemCare Advanced SystemCare\nAVG TuneUp\nOptimize PC performance, fix problems and customize your system\nTenorshare Windows Care Genius Memory and Hard Drive Cleaning Tool for Personal Computers\nSystimizer Systimizer is a PC junk cleaning & maintenance app which improves PC performance.\nsimplitec simplisafe\nMake your PC safer with simplisafe.\nMore\nAdvertisement\nDownload PC Booster 7\nDownload\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSafe download\nAdvertisement\n\u2014 User reviews \u2014 about PC Booster\nby yousef.a.alrasheed\t\t\t \"I doubt it!\" \t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt is strange that the result is always the same!!! before and after figures are always exactly the same, which gives me...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore.\nreviewed on August 10, 2013\nby originalparticle\t\t\t \"PC Booster 7, it worked for me.\" \t\t\t\t\t\t\tI have recently downloaded PC Booster 7.

See the reference section for additional layout recommendations.1. Use appropriate bypass capacitors (usually 0.1 \u00b5f and 1 \u00b5f) between VDD1 and GND1 and VDD2 and GND2.The capacitors should be placed as close as possible to the package. See the data sheet for exact details.2. Place bulk capacitors (10 \u00b5F) close to power components.3. Connect Enable pins either to the VDD or GND plane or use 10 kohms pull-up resistors. It is not recommended that they be left floating. This is especially critical in noisy environments.4. Use 45\u00b0 bends instead of right-angle (90\u00b0) bends for signals. This enhances impedance matching.5. To reduce inductances, avoid changing layers with signals.6. Use power and ground planes to control impedances and minimize noise from power components.7. Use short trace lengths between isolator and connecting circuits.8. To enhance the robustness of a design, it is further recommended that the user also add 1 \u00b5F bypasscapacitors and include 100 ohms resistors in series with the inputs and outputs if the system is excessively noisy..0commentsLabels:Guidelines\nOlder PostsHomeSubscribe to:Posts (Atom)Blog ArchiveBlog ArchiveSep 2012 (1)Jun 2010 (1)Mar 2010 (1)Feb 2010 (4)Jan 2010 (6)Feb 2009 (7)Jan 2009 (4)Jan 2005 (6)FollowersCategoriesDefinition(6)Guidelines(3)IPC-T-50(6)Layout(1)PCB(11)Via(1)WiFi(1).......\nNo copyright infringement intended.

The Metro interface requires a display resolution of 1024 x 768, but that is not always supported by the available display driver on this type of systems.Typically you can get this on systems with a Intel GMA 3150 or even an Intel 945 series chipset. The driver will only support the 1024 x 600, which will result in an error message stating \u201cThis app cannot open\u201d and/or \u201cThe screen resolution is too low for this app to run\u201d.There is a work around available that can work for this problem. It means installing the latest Intel driver for the graphics chipset (pick the latest Windows 7 driver if Windows 8 is not mentioned). Once installed, reboot to make sure everything is working.After that you need to edit the registry to force the resolution to be changed. So first make a backup of the registry so you can revert back to that in case of problems!After making the backup, open the registry editor (search for \u201cregedit\u201d), and press Ctrl+F to initiate a search of the registry. You need to search for the term \u201cDisplay1_DownScalingSupported\u201d and change the value from 0 to 1. After that, close the registry editor and reboot the computer.The last step is to actually change the screen resolution from the Control Panel and set it to 1078 x 768. After that the apps using the Metro interface should work fine.In case of problems, just reboot and press F8. Then select the Advanced Repair Options to start Windows in Safe Mode and restore the registry to the original settings. Then reboot and the screen should be fine again (although without the support for the 1078 x 768 resolution).\nTags: screen resolution, windows 8\nFreePCCleaner Software\nMarch 4, 2014\nby Jules \u00b7 Leave a CommentFiled under: PC Speed, Software Reviews\nPeople with Windows based computers sooner or later start wishing that their computer was as fast as when they bought it. With use Windows tends to get a bit slower every day.Most of this is the result of installing and uninstalling software, which leads to hard disk fragmentation and the registry growing. Fact is that not all software has a clean uninstall, so remnants will remain both on disk and in the Windows registry. In addition, more and more software try to install startup components, which will slow up the PC startup time.Running a disk cleanup on a regular basis will help, and if you also schedule a disk defrag, you will already benefit from better PC speed. Taking it a step further to reduce the number of startup programs, and cleaning the Windows registry, will also optimize PC performance.FreePCCleaner is a software program that can be used on Windows XP, Vista, 7 and 8 based computers to optimize the performance by cleaning and defragmenting the registry. There is also a feature to manage the startup programs.Using the program is very simple. After installation, you click the scan button and wait for the registry to be analyzed. Depending on the size of the registry and the computer speed, the scan can take a minute. But once the result is available, the software automatically creates a backup of the registry, and you can repair the errors found, which includes all cleanup.The Manage Startup feature allows you to see which programs all run at startup, which is more than only those in the All Progams -> Startup folder. A simple checkbox enables you to disable any program that you do not want to start automatically.Another useful feature is found in the Settings, and is a scheduler, that enables you to automatically run the program at predefined intervals. This way you don\u2019t forget to manually run FreePCCleaner.\nTags: manage startup, pc cleaner, Windows Registry\nOptimize VLC for Video Playback\nNovember 14, 2013\nby Jules \u00b7 Leave a CommentFiled under: Multimedia\nAlthough Windows Media Player has improved over the years, the best solution for media playback on Windows is still VLC in our opinion. The support for almost all audio and video formats is a great benefit, but it is also simple and straightforward to use.But if you are using VLC on a slower computer, maybe a Windows XP based system for example, you might face some performance problems with video playback. Especially large resolution videos requiring lots of processing can cause delays or rendering problems.It is however possible to tweak the VLC player a bit to ensure it will get all possible CPU resources when playing a video file. The general problem with multitasking operation system (like Windows), is that the CPU is shared amongst tasks, so a single process will never get all the CPU time.VLC has a setting that allows the user to increase the priority and as a result get more CPU time. This can help in playing the movie that just won\u2019t play properly on your computer!To change the VLC setting for increased performance, open the player, and in the Tools menu, select Preferences (or press Ctrl+P). This will bring up the Simple Preferences window.In the bottom left of the window, you need to select the All option for the Show settings feature.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This will change the thumbnail view on the left to a list view with more options.In the list, you need to select the Advanced option, and check the option named Increase the priority of the process.Although you can experiment with the Clock source option, generally the Auto setting will already do the trick.Click Save to store the settings and then play your media file again!.Note: Be prepared that the responsiveness of Windows and other applications will be a lot slower (although you should not run those in the first place when dealing with performance issues).\nTags: video playback, VLC\nSolved: Outlook 2010 Not Marking Emails as \u2018Replied\u2019\nMarch 1, 2013\nby Jules \u00b7 Leave a CommentFiled under: Outlook\nMy PC crashed the other day. I know, BUMMER! After re-installing everything, I noticed that in Outlook 2010, I was not seeing the REPLY mark or icon that marks emails I\u2019ve replied to. You know, that little purple arrow pointing to the left that tells me that I\u2019ve already addressed a particular message. This is how a Replied To message should look like.\u00a0If you receive a lot of emails like me on a daily basis, then you know how that that little arrow helps save you a lot of time because then you don\u2019t need to second guess yourself if something has been addressed or not!Anyway, on to our solution!How to Mark Emails as \u2018Replied\u2019 in Outlook 2010Open Outlook 2010.Click the View tab.In the Arrangement group, click Add Columns.Under Available Columns, click Icon and then click Add.Click the Move Up or Move Down buttons to position the Icon where you want it.Click OK.\nTags: outllok reply icon, outlook 2010\nOptimize your laptop\u2019s battery performance\nJuly 16, 2012\nby Anthony \u00b7 Leave a CommentFiled under: PC Maintenance, Software Reviews\nWe all know that using battery powered equipment has the disadvantage of the device running out of power. In the case of laptops running Windows, you can use the power management options to optimize the use of the battery by allowing the hard disk to be powered down and running the CPU at lower speeds.But of course there are more options to maximize the use of your laptop\u2019s battery. The more programs are running, the more the CPU is active. So disabling Windows features and services can further help to optimize the use of the battery.A useful program for this is called BatteryCare, which is free and can be downloaded from the BatteryCare.net website. It goes much further than the Windows power management options. You can see in the options that there are quite a few additional features to save energy.Most will cause no problems, but the option to disable the Windows services is something that needs to be tested, as it could conflict with specific software that you might be using.If you use the option to let BatteryCare control the power plans defined in Windows, you can disable the Windows battery icon in the notification area. Everything is accessible from the BatteryCare icon in that case anyway.BatteryCare also keeps track of the recharging cycles and will recommend a calibration after a defined number of cycles. This will help the battery indicator to be as accurate as possible, preventing you to be surprised by a low battery situation. Of course there are warning and notifications that can be configured, but if the basis for those notifications is incorrect information, the notifications come too late.For more information on battery optimization make sure to also look at our previous article on maximizing battery life.\nTags: laptop battery, optimize battery\nDo You Use Software to Make a Slide Show?\nMay 16, 2012\nby Anthony \u00b7 Leave a CommentFiled under: Software Reviews\nRemember the last time you showed your holiday photos to your friends.

There is nothing to stop anyone from continuing to use Windows XP, which, in April 2016, still ran about 5.0% of all desktop and laptop computers used to access the web. See the chart below of the operating systems used to access the web in December 2016.Due to their relatively low user bases, Windows XP and Windows 8.1 are now much less likely targets of cyber criminals than Windows 7 and 10. Moreover, those user bases are decreasing constantly, making it less and less attractive to those parasites. Windows 7 and Windows 10 are the dominant versions of Windows, as can be seen in the chart below.The official release date of Windows 10 was July 29, 2015. By December 2016, Windows 10 was running an estimated 27.15% of all desktop and laptop computers. The percentages in December 2016 for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 were 40.23% and 8.43% respectively. The data does not include devices that use the mobile Android operating system, no doubt because the use of Android is almost entirely on tablets and phones. Android is an open-source development of Linux by Google.Microsoft will be ending extended security support for Windows 7 SP1 on\u00a0 January 14, 2020.Microsoft Support Lifecycles [for all of its products] \u2013https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/gp/lifeselectVisit the following Wikipedia page for up-to-date information on the usage share of all of the operating systems in use on desktop, laptop, tablet PCs and smartphones.Usage share of operating systems \u2013https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systemsThe operating systems in use to browse the web \u2013 December 2016 \u2013 according to StatCounter.

Intel is only superior at the highest, most expensive level. Manufacturers can add more value to a PC that uses AMD CPUs because they are cheaper but just as good or better than Intel chips for most purposes. If you self-build a PC, you can buy a better motherboard, graphics card, etc with the savings, ending up with an all-round better machine.\nBrenda Blessed says:\nJuly 23, 2016 at 2:39 pm\nThis is a very useful site to learn about and keep up-to-date on computers.\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.

Welcome to The PC Guide! It seems that either your browser does not support frames, or you have them\ndisabled. The PC Guide makes extensive use of frames to facilitate easier navigation\nthrough the site. The PC Guide site uses a hierarchical structure of pages. The general\nrule of thumb is that the information on the site is displayed in the \"Contents\"\nframe, called \"C\", while the links deeper into the structure are in the\n\"Index\" frame, called \"I\". I realize that some people don't like frames, and that some don't have browsers that\nsupport them, so I have provided several ways to get to the information on the site for\nthose who fall into this category. You can find information on the site without using\nframes in three different ways: Some text browsers, like Lynx, don't support frames but allow browsing of framed sites\nby providing links to each frame from this page. If you see links to \"I\" and\n\"C\" above this text, you can use these links to travel the site. You can use the search engine to perform full\ntext searches on the site. You can use the no-frames version of the Topic\nIndex. This will let you move quickly to most areas of the site without using frames.\nTo get directly to the front page of the site without frames, click\nhere. Sincerely, Charles M.

Most of todays chart\nlibraries have a cost, our project is intended to be free. Data can be retrieved from SQL queries,\nCSV files, or manually provided. This project is still under development and new features or fix are made\nevery week.\nFocus has been put on rendering quality introducing an aliasing algorithm to draw eye candy graphics. Rendering\nspeed has been dramatically enhanced since the first version, we'll still continue optimising the code!\nTo run pChart on your web server, you'll need to use PHP compiled with the GD library support.\nLast updates / new features\n09.19.08\nVersion 1.27c is out! Introducing some fixes on the 1.27 tree. We've also (at least) introduced support for\nscatter line and plots. Thanks for your support!\n08.21.08\nVersion 1.27b is out! This time we've introduced background customisation, image map creation, transparent\ntext area and much more! It is now possible to create high quality graphics.\n08.08.08\nVersion 1.27 is out! This release is introducing error handling, some fixes and something\nheavily requested : supporting missing points.\nYou now have the ability to customize the X and Y axis specifying captions and data type.\nThe automatic scaling algorythm has been enhanced to build human readable scales when\npossible.\n07.21.08\nTons of small things have been fixed thanks to you! Bug reporting & feature requests are a good way to improve pChart and you're using it.\nWe'll still focus on enhancing this library making it faster & smoother!\n07.01.08\nSome bugs reported from the tracker and related to pie charts have been fixed. Introducing flat pie charts.\npCache - Compute once, display many times!\nSaving web server speed and CPU is something that matter to us. We've created the pCache class to help you\ndealing with the fact that a chart can be computed once and displayed many times by different users. The pCache\nclass can be used to simplify server side cache management. In green, the normal process : retrieve data, compute\nand display, in orange the cost saving path, retrieve the data, check if we have already computed it and\ndisplay it!\nCharting live data\nFollowing graph is refreshed every hour retrieving data from the\nSourceForge.net project statistics page. The generation of this chart is made trough a scheduled task using the cron daemon. You can find\nmore information on how to planify chart drawing by going in the help.\nDocumentation\nThe documentation is trying to explain how to use, adapt and bring to production pChart scripts.\nExemples are covering basic usage or highlighting specific features, we invite you to try by yourself.\nIf you can't find any solution to your issues in this documentation, please use the sourceforge forums.\nBefore thinking doing graphics you must understand the Data Structure used by the pChart library.\nYou'll find all the informations here. To help you dealing with your data transformation we've made\nthe pData.class. The use of this class is up to you, if you feel comfortable dealing with array you can skip it.\nSee the documentation\nBe notified!\nSourceforge is offering a service to monitor when package are updated, this is a great way\nto be notified everytime a new release of pChart is available. To activate this functionality\nclick on the following link :\nStay informed!\nBug reporting\nPlease use the reporting interface provided by sourceforge to track down issues and request additional\nfeatures. We need a single point of reporting to be able to provide a quality oriented service. We're\nwaiting for your feedback to bring this library highter. Reporting bugs is an important way to contribute\nto this project! Thanks in advance!\nBring me to the support!\nLicensing\nThe pChart library and all of its files are released under the GNU General Public License that you can\nread here. The GPL license allow you to use, modify,\nredistribute the pChart class into all GPL licensed products.\nAre you using it?\nIf you are using pChart on one of your public web site or embeded in one of your application, please, drop us a\nnote!

PCM Focus are in charge and are running the event from the first half of May for a little over 1 month, until the end of June. As usual, different phases will make up this prestigious tournament, which will kick off with Solo events, and continue with the Team ones. As usual, the winners of each discipline at the solo world cup, as well as the winners of the general classification at the team world cup, will be rewarded with a Steam version of Pro Cycling Manager 2017. You can take a look at the official announcement in here, or go straight to the main forum instead, where you will be able to sign up until the end of the 5th of May. Furthermore, it's a good idea to remind you that the first edition of the PCM Champions League, the tournament organised by 5 different communities, is soon going to see the light of day. If you were strong or lucky enough to make it in through one of the forums' own tournaments, you probably know that the first medals will be awarded on Tuesday 25 April, and the competition will round out on the 3rd of May, just a few days before the start of the PCM World Cup. If you, however, like most would just like to follow the outcome with curiosity you will be able to through the official channels listed in the previous news about this same topic.

Almost about 1 GB of RAM is always free if you don't install many apps. The chipset has sensors like accelerometer, light sensor, gyro sensor, magnetic sensor, and compass. Having the gyro sensor makes this phone suitable for enjoying the VR content on a VR headset. Also, the compass makes navigation easy in Google Maps. This is good to note that we are getting gyro and compass (magnetometer) in this phone.2. GPUThis phone has Adreno 308 GPU. The Adreno 308 is an entry-level GPU which can also run heavy android games but with frame loss.3. ScreenThe Redmi 4A equips a 5 inch HD IPS touchscreen with a resolution of 1280x720 pixels. The PPI density is 296. The screen clarity is good and viewing angles are perfect. The phone also has built-in \"Read mode\" which helps to reduce eye strain while using the phone in the dark. Because of an HD screen, the battery performance is greatly increased. The screen is protected by a 2.5D curved glass protection. Installing a tempered glass screen protector is mandatory for this phone.\u00a0The screen\u2019s superior color production can be seen while watching a Full HD (1920x1080) video. There is an option in the 'Settings' which will let you change the screen's color temperature between warm and cool. The screen also supports double tap to wake it up.4. CameraThe main camera is 13 MP with a single LED flash and autofocus feature. The selfie camera is 5 MP. Both the cameras are of f/2.2 aperture. The cameras do not have any image stabilization technology. So, while capturing photos make sure not to shake or move the phone.5. BatteryXiaomi Redmi 4A has a 3000 mAh non-removable Li-ion polymer battery. The phone doesn't support fast charging. The USB charger's rating is 5V-1A which can take anywhere between 1.5-2 hours to fully charge the battery from 0-100%. While charging the phone no heating is encountered. A notification LED below the home button lights up in red color while charging.6.

The phone supports 4G/LTE in both SIM slots but only one SIM will work in 4G at a time the other will work in 3G/WCDMA. It also supports VoLTE. The GPS location services are managed by BDS, AGPS, and GLONASS. It also has FM radio with recording support.7. Android OSIt runs android 6.0.1 Marshmallow OS with December security patch. Android Nougat update will not come to this phone. The phone comes with some pre-installed apps that you can uninstall easily. Bloatware apps are not found on Xiaomi Redmi 4A which is a good thing.8. MIUI v8It runs the MIUI v8 user interface above the android OS. We can customize the MIUI v8 with custom themes and wallpapers all provided by Xiaomi. The good thing about MIUI v8 is that we get all the useful apps pre-installed on the phone. These apps include a music player, and advanced file manager app, a scanner app, an advanced calculator, security app, built-in read mode, built-in app and privacy lock. So we don't need to install third party apps most of the time.9. OEM AppsXiaomi Redmi 4A is coming with some OEM android apps. These high-quality apps include a file manager, music player, calculator, voice recorder, antivirus, and scanner app.10. Loudspeaker Sound and Call QualityThe Redmi 4A has a dedicated loudspeaker which is very loud and clear. Call quality is also very good and is free from noise. The call dialer app is good enough and automatically tells the country location of the phone numbers that you type, but they are always not correct especially when you are dialing a mobile number within your country. The calling app interface is nice with useful buttons like hold, speaker, disable mic and add a new call (conference call), call recording, add note and a direct video call. The direct video call will only work with Xiaomi Redmi phones. If you make a direct video call from your Redmi phone to a non-Redmi phone then the call will be converted to a voice call.The call settings let you set up IP dialing, unwanted call blocking, and SIP calling.

The front camera is 5 MP with f/2.2 aperture. The selfie camera is just like the one that you find in most phones which come at a price between 12,000-15,000 INR. So the selfie camera is very good and takes good selfies in indoor lighting conditions. Low light photography is not good on this phone. But if you turn on the HDR then the low light images will improve a little bit but comes out to be grainy. The camera captures a lot more detail while using the flash in the night. In sunlight, the images come with high fidelity colors.Daylight Photo with HDR Mode\u279c See the above image in full resolution - check hereLow light photo with HDR\u279c See the above image in full resolution - check hereLow light photo without HDR\u279c See the above image in full resolution - check herePhoto with LED flash\u279c See the above image in full resolution - check hereThe camera app is also very good and easy to use.

The camera focuses objects accurately even in low light which helps it to take sharp and detailed images. But make sure while taking photos do not shake the phone otherwise the photos will become blurry. This is because Xiaomi Redmi 4A's camera doesn't have any image stabilization technology. At just 5,999 rupees the camera is offering some high-quality features except the EIS or OIS. If not considering the image stabilization and low light photography on this phone then you can take some high-quality photos in daylight and even in the night with LED flash. But keep your phone steady while capturing photos.Xiaomi Redmi 4A Gaming PerformanceThe Xiaomi Redmi 4A houses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 chipset which is actually not meant for heavy gaming. If you are an average gamer then this phone will not disappoint you. You can enjoy games like temple run, Super Mario Run without any lag or performance issues.

With this new feature we can now send GIF images on WhatsApp. However WhatsApp takes these images as video files. With further updates the many GIF images came as part of WhatsApp. Now we don't have to manually search and share GIF images because WhatsApp has got its own GIF library built into it. It is quite quick to share since we don't have to search and share in the chrome browser.Now most android phone's use the stock Google keyboard which is now known as Gboard. With older versions we were unable to insert GIF images from Gboard in WhatsApp chats. Doing so always thrown an error as \"this text field does not support GIF insertion from keyboard\". Now with the newer version this error doesn't appear anymore. We can now successfully use Gboard to search and insert GIF images into WhatsApp chats. For this you don't need to open the Google app or chrome browser and the search will occur in the keyboard app itself.\u00a0Download WhatsApp 2.17.111 APKHow to Insert GIF Images From Gboard on WhatsAppOpen any chat and tap the text field to open the Gboard. Now long tap the 'emoticons' key on the keyboard.\u00a0\u00a0Tap the 'GIF' option and insert the images of your choice.

At this time I'm sure like me you have felt like smashing your pc into smithereens. At some point in your life you will work on a pc and it will return an error, all be it a laptop or desktop. When this happens unless you are a whizz kid it can take a long time to learn how to fix it. The alternative is to take it to a pc repair shop where they charge you a small fortune to fix it for you and in some cases stretch the truth or lie to charge you more. Let some anger out by smashing your computer up in a fun way with these games. I personally like smash the pc for the satisfaction you get from constantly hitting the mouse button at various places to smash the pc up. By the way if anyone is looking for reliable free virus software protection, then you should consider Avast or AVG - this is a personal recommendation and the basic software is free for personal use.

Bonding takes the 5N2 from a device that can perform solidly on two separate networks to one that can offer almost twice the performance on a single subnet. While Drobo increased the processing capability to support the additional network throughput, we were beginning to encroach upon the seek performance of NAS-grade HDDs when attempting to serve two simultaneous Gigabit streams. DroboApps has grown to cover the majority of things you would possibly want to run on a home NAS, and DroboDR offers off-site backup (to another Drobo). Overall, the combination of Drobo's BeyondRAID, bonded Gigabit Ethernet, 5 drive bays, and a competitive price point, make for a compelling NAS package worthy of serious consideration for any home or small business network storage needs.\"\nRyan Shrout\nFULL STORY @\nPCPER\nTUNAI CLIP Review\nMon, Apr 24 2017 | 4:03P | Audio / Sound |\nPermaLink\nPosted by:\nSTAFF\nTUNAI Creative is a new company here for us at ThinkComputers.\nLooking at their product lineup they currently offer two products, the CLIP, which we are taking a look at today and the Firefly.\nBoth are Bluetooth audio products.\nThe clip is an interesting product as its main function is to bring wireless connectivity to your favorite set of wired headphones.\nIt also gives you a voice assistant, microphone for taking calls, and has a range of 250 feet in the open air.\nCLIP comes along at an interesting time where many mobile devices are dropping support of the 3.5 mm jack.\nIf you have a favorite pair of headphones that are wired this could be the perfect thing for you!\nRead on as we take a look...\"\nFULL STORY @\nTHINKCOMPUTERS\nASUS RoG Crosshair VI Hero X370 Motherboard Review\nMon, Apr 24 2017 | 4:02P | Motherboards |\nPermaLink\nPosted by:\nSTAFF\nRyzen is here at last, and with that comes dozens of motherboards from the many AMD partners.

It\u2019s primed to appeal to enthusiast system builders, overclockers and gamers alike, so let\u2019s take a closer look at what it has to offer!\nFULL STORY @\nETEKNIX\nSapphire NITRO+ Radeon RX 580 Limited Edition Video Card Review\nMon, Apr 24 2017 | 4:01P | Video Cards |\nPermaLink\nPosted by:\nSTAFF\nThe AMD Radeon RX 500 series was released this week and the new Polaris based graphics card series consists of the Radeon RX 580, RX 570, RX 560 and RX 550. These cards are mostly all based on the Polaris architecture found on the RX 400 series as they use the same cores. AMD tinkered under the hood of the Polaris GPU a bit and took advantage of improvements in the manufacturing process to get higher clock speeds than they could get last year when the RX 400 series was launched. AMD didn't send over any reference models this time around, so we were given the Sapphire NITRO+ Radeon RX 580 Limited Edition graphics card. This is a factory overclocked model and just happens to be the fastest Radeon RX 580 that you can buy today from Sapphire.\nFULL STORY @\nLEGITREVIEWS\n3D stackable phase change memory\nMon, Apr 24 2017 | 4:00P | Memory |\nPermaLink\nPosted by:\nSTAFF\nXPoint. Optane. QuantX. We've been hearing these terms thrown around for two years now. A form of 3D stackable phase change memory that promised 10x the density of DRAM and 1000x the speed and endurance of NAND. These were bold statements, and over the following months, we would see them misunderstood and misconstrued by many in the industry. These misconceptions were further amplified by some poor demo choices on the part of Intel (fortunately countered by some better choices made by Micron). Fortunately cooler heads prevailed as Jim Handy and other industry analysts helped explain that a 1000x improvement at the die level does not translate to the same improvement at the device level, especially when the first round of devices must comply with what will soon become a legacy method of connecting a persistent storage device to a PC.\nFULL STORY @\nPCPER\ngaming keyboards offer customizable backlighting\nMon, Apr 24 2017 | 12:03P | Peripherals |\nPermaLink\nPosted by:\nSTAFF\nSome gaming keyboards offer customizable backlighting and key caps to change up the feel of the keys underneath one's fingers. EpicGear's Defiant keyboard goes one better and lets gamers change out its key switches themselves for a different tactile experience. We switched around the Defiant's clickers to see if the feature upped our game.\nFULL STORY @\nTECHREPORT\nThe performance of the new Ryzen 7 CPU\nMon, Apr 24 2017 | 12:02P | CPU / Processors |\nPermaLink\nPosted by:\nSTAFF\nThe performance of the new Ryzen 7 CPU from AMD has beed causing a lot of controversy: it is faster than its competitor in some tests, but it is slower in other ones, and several theories have been raised about the reason why. A popular theory says that disabling the SMT feature, the performance actually improves. Let\u2019s test if is it true.\nWe published recently the Ryzen 7 1700X Review. It is a new CPU from AMD, based on a brand new architecture. We concluded that the Ryzen 7 1700X is faster that the Core i7-7700K in some tasks, but slower on other ones, including most games we tested.\nFULL STORY @\nHARDWARESECRETS\nRoccat Kone EMP Gaming Mouse Review\nMon, Apr 24 2017 | 12:01P | Mouse Pads |\nPermaLink\nPosted by:\nSTAFF\nBeing the successor to the Kone XTD, the Kone EMP (Empowered) brings a few new things to the table.

Since this breaks the rules for apps available on Apple's App Store, Tim Cook had stern words with the company and told them in no uncertain terms that if the practice did not end then Uber would be kicked off the store.\nThe tracking referred specifically to a tool that allowed Uber to watch for when people deleted the app and then find them again when it was re-installed. Uber claims that the tool was necessary to fight against fraud and that it is a common practice \u2013 but it was in contravention of Apple's privacy laws and was kept completely secret from the users being tracked.The trick relied on a special tool called \"fingerprinting\" that allowed Uber to identify the phones that downloaded its app. When someone then deleted it again, it kept that \"fingerprint\" and watched for it downloading the Uber app over again \u2013 allowing the company to know if it had been re-installed on the same phone.Click to expand...

Thankfully the reviews of the Samsung Galaxy S8 smartphone seem to be overwhelmingly positive, with some reviewers describing the handset as the best phone that money can buy right now. That being said, at nearly \u00a3700 all this good stuff comes with a hefty price tag.\nThe Galaxy S8+ is one gorgeous piece of tech with its Infinity display and no amount of black bars can take that away from it. Plus, it's not like having bezels in their place will do your videos any good...The chipset is the fastest around, while the software is more polished than ever. And while the battery capacity hasn't been increased over the S7 edge, the endurance is improved when it comes to web browsing and video watching.Click to expand...\n- GSM Arena\nSamsung's latest is a gorgeous bit of portable tech, packed with cutting-edge performance and loads and loads of helpful, handy perks. The iPhone 7 is no slouch in terms of performance, app selection, and overall quality of use, but put these head to head and you get a lot more benefits with the Galaxy S8.And maybe most pressingly, it feels new and exciting while the iPhone 7 sticks with the old and familiar, for the most part. The Galaxy S8 has top-of-the-line everything and turns heads in the process, while the iPhone 7 can't help but feel a little tired.Click to expand...\n- Stuff\nWell, the Samsung Galaxy S8 is comfortably the best phone I\u2019ve ever used. It\u2019s fast, looks great, has a fantastic camera and has a screen that will do any photos captured justice.There are a couple of missteps \u2013 the fingerprint scanner is in a silly place that will lead to many a smudged lens, and Bixby feels underdeveloped \u2013 but for the most part, this is a product from a company at the top of its game.Click to expand...\n- AlphrRead more\nViews: 145 / Likes: 2 / Replies: 3\nby Becky, Apr 21, 2017 at 12:48 PM\nLawsuit alleges that Bose headphones spy on listeners\nA man is filing an injunction against Bose to prevent the company from listening in on users of their headphones and selling the data to third parties. The lawsuit alleges that the company is using their app to track what customers use their headphones to listen to. Reuters has more:\nAfter paying $350 for his QuietComfort 35 headphones, Zak said he took Bose's suggestion to \"get the most out of your headphones\" by downloading its app, and providing his name, email address and headphone serial number in the process.But the Illinois resident said he was surprised to learn that Bose sent \"all available media information\" from his smartphone to third parties such as Segment.io, whose website promises to collect customer data and \"send it anywhere.\"Audio choices offer \"an incredible amount of insight\" into customers' personalities, behavior, politics and religious views, citing as an example that a person who listens to Muslim prayers might \"very likely\" be a Muslim, the complaint said.\"Defendants' conduct demonstrates a wholesale disregard for consumer privacy rights,\" the complaint said.Click to expand...

The renderings and diagrams show a device with an edge-to-edge screen, no home button, and a minimal bezel around the edge.\nAccording to the diagram, the iPhone 8's display measures 5.768 inches on the diagonal and will indeed cover nearly the entire front of the device. There appears to be only a 4 mm bezel around all four sides of the display, with over half of that being the 2.5D curved glass at the edges and the remainder appearing to be the device's frame around the sides. The drawing shows a narrow earpiece at the top of the device's front, with various cameras, sensors, and other components on either side of the earpiece. Those components would likely include a front-facing camera, small microphone hole, ambient light sensor, proximity sensor, and the rumored 3D sensor.Click to expand...\nRead more here.Read more\nViews: 209 / Likes: 1 / Replies: 5\nby Becky, Apr 18, 2017\nAMD Ryzen 5 microprocessors overview\nThe Ryzen 5 CPU was released yesterday, and The Inquirer has been taking a look at how the chip has been received by reviewers:\nThe Ryzen 5 will weigh in at between $169 and $249, or around \u00a3170 to \u00a3250 in the UK, including the 20 per cent protection money demanded by Her Majesty.

That was until I tried PDF Download.\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\tPDF Download prevents this problem ever arising by allowing you to control exactly how and when PDF files are opened or downloaded. Instead of opening PDF files \"blind\" which is currently the case, PDF Download lets you know exactly how big it is with options of whether to convert it, open it, download it or convert to HTML. PDF Download stops the annoying problem of PDF files taking ages to open - especially big ones. With PDF Download, you can see instantly whether its a big file, in which case, it's advisable to download it for reading later as opening a big PDF file is like waiting for Christmas to arrive sometimes.\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\tThe PDF Download plugin usually presents you with 3 options unless you've instructed it to do the same thing by default all the time - convert the PDF to HTML, download the PDF or open the PDF in the browser. One bonus with PDF Download, that perhaps separates it from others, is that it's not just limited to Adobe Reader. PDF Download also works with Foxit Reader and other PDF readers although to be honest, if you're using Foxit, you won't find much use for PDF Download anyway as it opens PDF files much more smoothly than Adobe Reader.\nPDF Download is an excellent PDF tool which will result in fewer Firefox crashes although not everytime as it still seems susceptible to crashes when opening PDF files in the browser.\nChanges\nWeb to PDF feature Better PDF to HTML Cleaner interface Wider browser support\nAdvertisement\n\u2014 Add-ons \u2014\nTop downloads\nAdblock Plus for Chrome Customisable and powerful ad-blocking tool\nPDF Download\nChoose how to open PDF files in Firefox\nZenMate VPN for Chrome Excellent proxy switcher add-on\nHola Unlimited Free VPN Excellent proxy switcher to unblock regional video restrictions\n8 Ball Pool - Miniclip Free and addictive Multiplayer Pool Game\nMore\nLatest apps\nGmail Templates An Extension to Help You Work Faster\nGoogle Mail Checker Gmail extension for Chrome\nThe Camelizer Price Watching Made Easy\nMake America Kittens Again Fun Software to Replace Donald Trump Images with Kittens\nRename Email User-Friendly Software to Change the Headline of a Received Email\nMore\nAdvertisement\nDownload PDF Download\nfor Firefox per Firefox 3.0.0.2.1\nFree Download\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSafe download\nAdvertisement\n\u2014 User reviews \u2014 about PDF Download\nby Surya Sekhar1069208984\t\t\t \"good application\" \t\t\t\t\t\t\tnow a days neet to convert files into pdf,this is very useful programme and easy installation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore.\nreviewed on February 14, 2017\nby Tino Adatum\t\t\t \"it so good all the world\" \t\t\t\t\t\t\tpdf is very good it help every in the world to save document.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore.\nreviewed on January 10, 2017\nby Tistia Delfi Aulia\t\t\t \"VERY NICE APPLICATIONS\" \t\t\t\t\t\t\tTHIS APPLICATION IS ONE VERY GOOD, CAN Facilitate PERKERJAN OR IN MY ASSIGNMENT.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore.\nreviewed on August 16, 2016\nRead all reviews Review\nAdvertisement\n\u2014 You may also like \u2014\nPDF reDirect Merge and rotate PDF documents for printing\nFree English\nABBYY PDF Transformer Convert, create and transform PDF documents\nTrial version English\nMozilla Firefox Mozilla sets the benchmark for web browsers\nFree (GPL) English\nWeeny Free PDF Cutter cut PDF into small pieces\nFree English\n\u2014 Features \u2014 about PDF Download\nlist Best free iPad apps\nlist Ask OnSoftware: Effortlessly open PDF files in Firefox\ntips Three easy ways to convert web pages to PDF\nlist Top 10 PDF tips\nRead more stories\nLaws concerning the use of this software vary from country to country.

Give it a PDF file, and you can convert it to Microsoft Word format.\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\tPDF to Word in moments\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\tPDFs are widely used, but require a reader or browser plugin, and furthermore they are not easy to edit. Free PDF to Word Converter quickly converts PDF files into Word .DOC files that you can edit. This free version is really basic, but still allows you to choose whether to convert your PDF with images or not.\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\tAll you really need to use Free PDF to Word Converter is the Input file field, which will open a Finder window so you can import your PDF, and the Start Conversion button, along with the four check buttons for its minimal options.\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\tMore buttons than necessary\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\tEverything else on Free PDF to Word Converter either opens a web page, from a 'like us on Facebook' prompt, to 'donate to us via Paypal', and the developer's home page. You can also check out the 'Pro' version of the app. This is included in the installation as a demo, which you can buy from the app. The pro version has a cleaner and larger interface, with many more options and useful things like a preview pane.\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\tFree PDF to Word Converter gives you pretty good converted Word files. The formatting is not always great, but once you have all the content from a PDF in Word, you can easily edit it yourself.\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\tA neat little app with too many unwanted extras\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\tThe only real criticism we can have of Free PDF to Word Converter is the sheer volume of buttons and links designed to make you pay for the pro version and so on. The installer also has a lot of 'offers' which you need to decline if all you want is this app. Having the pro version installed with this free version also means it takes up more disk space than necessary - although you can uninstall that separately.\nAuthor's review\nConvert PDF file to office Word document free\nPDF To Word Converter Free is a powerful freeware application for intelligently converting PDF to easily editable Word DOC documents.

They are either ugly, slow, lack functions or, more often, all three. Will PDF-XChange Viewer be any different?\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\tIt is! Viewing PDFs with PDF-XChange Viewer is fast and smooth - you can skip through and back pages, view documents in a variety of layouts, and search and find pages and keywords seamlessly. PDF-XChange Viewer's toolbars are totally customizable, and there is a considerable range of configuration options.\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\tPDF-XChange Viewer's editing options are also impressive. Although the free version doesn't allow you to create documents from scratch, it does let you edit extensively, with a few exceptions, mainly the ability to add or remove pages. Commenting, underlining, stamping, attaching files and creating text boxes are all easily done, and can be modified and removed in the click of a button.\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\tThere are also tooltips, so you know what you are doing before you click. This feature is very welcome, as the PDF-XChange Viewer help is not very good. Additional cool features include a snapshot tool, document preview when opening PDFs and a huge range of interface language options.\nPDF-XChange Viewer is a great PDF editor that is streets ahead of its many rivals.\nChanges\nFixed crash when opening some XFA-files Fixed behaviour when document is opened from LAN (or from removable storage) when the connection has been lost Fixed issue with /importp command-line parameter Exclusive commenting mode: fixed behaviour for right clicking PDF Engine \tResolved issue with printing rectangles with zero width or height Added two new events \"Notifications.BeforeCloseDoc\" and \"Notifications.DocClosed\" Fixed grammar on resume message when returning from suspend Resolved issue with unicode subject on Send by Email\nAdvertisement\n\u2014 PDF \u2014\nTop downloads\nAdobe Reader Adobe Reader 11: the essential PDF viewer\nFree Word to PDF Converter Organise your documents with Free Word to PDF Converter\nPDF To Word Converter Free Convert PDF file to office Word document for free\nFree PDF Reader No surprises\nAdobe Acrobat Pro DC\t Adobe's professional PDF authoring and management tool\nMore\nLatest apps\nPDF-XChange PRO Efficient and Streamlined Software to Create and Edit PDF Files\nPDFescape Editor Free PDF Editor for Desktop Computers\nPDF Server for Windows 2016 User-Friendly PDF Converter for Personal Computers\nPDF Annotation Free PDF Annotation Software for Mobile Devices\nPDF Annotation Lite Free PDF Annotation Software for Mobile Devices\nMore\n\u2014 Related searches \u2014about pdf-xchange viewer\nfree pdf xchange viewer full version\npdf xchange viewer\npdf xchange viewer 2.5.207\nAdvertisement\nDownload PDF-XChange Viewer 2.5.313.1\nDownload\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSafe download\nAdvertisement\n\u2014 User reviews \u2014 about PDF-XChange Viewer\nby tomsteinberger\t\t\t \"Perfect, but small request.\" \t\t\t\t\t\t\tPerfect, I\u00b4m missing possibility how to collect more object then only one.Maybe it is possible but actually have not fi...\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore.\nreviewed on March 31, 2016\n\"Splendid product!Using it for all my computers\" \t\t\t\t\t\t\tOffers great functions even as a trial version so how splendid would the full product be!.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore.\nreviewed on March 11, 2016\nby JoyceWillis2020\t\t\t \"Best FREE PDF Viewer\" \t\t\t\t\t\t\tFast, reliable, does the job it's supposed to do and it's FREE...EXCELLENT program all round.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore.\nreviewed on February 24, 2015\n\"PDF-XChange Viewer is excellent for different works with pdf-files\" \t\t\t\t\t\t\tPDF-XChange Viewer is my prefer software for reading and working with PDFs.

It works directly from programs like Word.\nEditor's note: During installation, some antivirus (e.g. NOD32) may\u00a0detect virus threats. It is a false positive:\u00a0PDFCreator is guaranteed as safe by our Certified Softonic Antivirus.\nCreate a perfect PDF in a snap\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\tPDFCreator is a virtual printer for saving\u00a0files in PDF - it\u00a0has a huge number of options, from simply rotating the page to the compression level of images and text. For less advanced users we recommend you use the default profile and, at most, choose just one of the preset settings.\u00a0\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\tMore advanced users, however, can create a customized PDF by\u00a0playing around with the setup menu.\u00a0\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\tNot only that, you can also password protect documents with three different levels of encryption, include a digital signature, as well as automatically sending the document via email or to the printer.\u00a0\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\tPDFCreator has different modes of virtual printing, in addition to creating a PDF you can also\u00a0convert PDF to PNG, JPEG, BMP, TXT, RAW, and many other formats, just by following\u00a0the same procedure that you used to create the PDF.\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\tTwo ways to create PDFs\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\tPDFCreator may initially confuse those who aren't\u00a0familiar with virtual printers. It's therefore important to know that you must first have already prepared the file you want to convert. So make sure you have a text document, an image, an Excel file, a presentation or an email.\u00a0\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\tThere are two ways to create the PDF file:\u00a0\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t- Open the document with the native program (for example, if it's a DOC, open it with Microsoft Word), click on Print and choose PDFCreator as your printer.\u00a0\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t- Open PDFCreator, select Document/Add from the toolbar. Choose All Files from the drop-down menu, select the path and click on Save.\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\tA virtual printer that easily creates PDFs\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\tThe\u00a0PDFCreator interface is pretty sparse. The program converts text files to PDF fine, but could give problems with file layouts\u00a0containing lots of images. If the file doesn't\u00a0convert properly, you can try alternatives like doPDF or FreePDF.\u00a0\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\tPDFCreator is an excellent solution if you want to, for example, convert\u00a0a CV to PDF to share but you don't\u00a0want it to be changed - it's also a great solution for simply avoiding formatting problems.\t\t\t\t Changes\nPlease visit http://www.pdfforge.org/blog for full changelog.\nAdvertisement\n\u2014 PDF \u2014\nTop downloads\nAdobe Reader Adobe Reader 11: the essential PDF viewer\nFree Word to PDF Converter Organise your documents with Free Word to PDF Converter\nPDF To Word Converter Free Convert PDF file to office Word document for free\nFree PDF Reader No surprises\nAdobe Acrobat Pro DC\t Adobe's professional PDF authoring and management tool\nMore\nLatest apps\nPDF-XChange PRO Efficient and Streamlined Software to Create and Edit PDF Files\nPDFescape Editor Free PDF Editor for Desktop Computers\nPDF Server for Windows 2016 User-Friendly PDF Converter for Personal Computers\nPDF Annotation Free PDF Annotation Software for Mobile Devices\nPDF Annotation Lite Free PDF Annotation Software for Mobile Devices\nMore\n\u2014 Related searches \u2014about pdfcreator\npdfcreator 1.3.2\npdfcreator 1.7.2\npdfcreator 1.9.0\npdfcreator 1.6.0\npdfcreator 0.9.5\npdfcreator 0.8.0\nfree pdfcreator 9.0\npdfcreator 1.6.1\nAdvertisement\nDownload PDFCreator 2.3.0\nFree Download\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSafe download\nAdvertisement\n\u2014 User reviews \u2014 about PDFCreator\nby jamescarroll876563374\t\t\t \"A fallen star\" \t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy far the best PDF virtual printer for Windows... until February 2009 (version 0.9.7).

Some malicious PDF files even contain malware which may infect your system. When you receive a pdf file with Email, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Snapchat, Line, Telegram, Skype, ICQ,\nor other software, download a pdf file from the Internet( including torrent sites, online chat rooms ), you should always scan it with an antivirus software before opening it to keep your system secure.\nIn a word, by converting pdf to jpeg files, you can view, edit, print and manage your documents on any device easily without installing professional pdf editor or pdf viewer which may cost you much money, viewing files in JPEG format will use less RAM and keep your device more secure, make the pdf more portable, and make your digital life more beautiful.\nHow to convert PDF to jpg images on Windows 7, Windows 10, Mac OS X, iPhone, iPad or SamSung Galaxy?\n1.

API Getting Started Examples Code Generator\nVisit this project on Github\nNote regarding Mozilla Firefox: (December 2016) There is a known issue with Mozilla Firefox, which prevents PDFObject from properly detecting PDF support. Mozilla has removed the application/PDF MIME type from Firefox, despite built-in support for rendering PDFs. They are currently debating whether to restore this feature. PDFObject will not be updated until Mozilla has reached a final solution. Sorry for the inconvenience. If you absolutely must embed PDFs in Firefox, for now there are two options: Use static markup (the handy generator can help you) or use your own copy of PDF.js and PDFObject's forcePDFJS option (this is a sledgehammer technique). Hopefully Mozilla will reverse their decision. Note to PDFObject 1.x users: PDFObject 2.0 introduces breaking changes and is NOT backwards-compatible with PDFObject 1.x. Browser support: PDFObject 2.0 is designed for modern browsers, and has been successfully tested in Chrome, Firefox, Safari (OS X and iOS), IE 9-11, and MS Edge. If you find issues or would like to share your own testing results, please post an issue in GitHub. IMPORTANT: Browser support for PDFObject does not mean the browser supports PDF embedding! PDFObject only embeds PDFs in browsers that support PDF embedding. Some browsers do not natively support PDF embedding, including Safari for iOS and Internet Explorer [chart]. For browsers that do not support PDF embedding, PDFObject provides a way for you to display alternate content. Read below for details.\n1. Create a container to hold your PDF<div id=\"example1\"></div>2. Tell PDFObject which PDF to embed, and where to embed it<script src=\"/js/pdfobject.js\"></script><script>PDFObject.embed(\"/pdf/sample-3pp.pdf\", \"#example1\");</script>3. You can optionally use CSS to specify visual styling, including dimensions, border, margins, etc.<style>.pdfobject-container { height: 500px;}.pdfobject { border: 1px solid #666; }</style>\nQuestion: Is JavaScript required for embedding PDFs in your HTML page? Answer: No. In fact, here are some examples for embedding PDFs in your web page using pure HTML markup without JavaScript, if you'd rather go that route.\nWhy use PDFObject? PDFObject 2.0 detects browser support for inline/embedded PDFs. (In case you were wondering, your browser\nembedded PDFs. ) If you're working with dynamic HTML, such as a single-page web app, you may need to insert PDFs on-the-fly. However, PDF embedding is not supported by certain browsers. If you insert markup without first checking for PDF support, you could wind up with missing content or a broken UI. The PDFObject utility helps you avoid these situations by detecting support for PDF embedding in the browser; if embedding is supported, the PDF is embedded. If embedding is NOT supported by the browser, the PDF will NOT be embedded. By default, PDFObject 2.0 inserts a fallback link to the PDF when the browser does not support inline PDFs. This ensures your users always have access to your PDF, and is designed to help you write less code. The fallback link can be customized, or the option can be disabled if you prefer. PDFObject 2.0 is npm-ready. Modern web apps use npm to manage packages and dependencies. PDFObject 2.0 is registered with Node Package Manager (npm) and can be loaded dynamically. PDFObject also makes it easy to specify Adobe's proprietary \"PDF Open Parameters\". (Be warned these parameters are only supported by Adobe Reader, most PDF readers will ignore the parameters, including the built-in PDF readers in Chrome, Internet Explorer, and Safari. Read more below.) What PDFObject doesn't do PDFObject is not a rendering engine. PDFObject just writes an <embed> element to the page, and relies on the browser or browser plugins to render the PDF. If the browser does not support embedded PDFs, PDFObject is not capable of forcing the browser to render the PDF. If you need to force browsers to display a PDF, we suggest using Mozilla's PDF.js. Note that PDF.js is subject to its own limitations, such as cross-domain security restrictions. PDFObject and PDF.js play well together, there are links to some great PDF.js examples in the Examples section below. PDFObject does not provide the ability to customize the look and feel of the PDF toolbar. The toolbar is controlled by the browser, and will vary widely from browser to browser (Chrome versus Safari versus Firefox, etc.). Some of these browsers provide the ability to show or hide the toolbar, or a feature such as the search field, via PDF Open Parmeters. However, in general the browsers do NOT provide any mechanism for customizing the toolbar. If you really need to customize the toolbar, try forking Mozilla's PDF.js and customizing it to suit your needs. PDFObject does not validate the existence of the PDF, or that the PDF is actually rendered. The assumption is that you are specifying a valid URL and the network is functioning normally. PDFObject does not check for 404 errors, and JavaScript cannot detect whether the PDF actually renders, unless you are using PDF.js, which is outside the scope of PDFObject. PDFObject does not magically implement PDF Open Parameters. As mentioned above, these parameters are not widely supported. The PDF rendering engine either supports them or doesn't \u2014 PDFObject cannot force the rendering engine to implement these features.\n^ Back to top\nAPI PDFObject provides two properties and one method.\nPDFObject.supportsPDFs [property] Returns true or false based on detection of navigator.mimeTypes['application/pdf'] and/or ActiveX AcroPDF.PDF or PDF.PdfCtrl. PDFObject does not perform detection for specific vendors (Adobe Reader, FoxIt, PDF.js, etc.). Note: For those who wish to target PDF.js, there is an option in PDFObject.embed() to force use of PDF.js. Read below for more details. if(PDFObject.supportsPDFs){\nconsole.log(\"Yay, this browser supports inline PDFs.\");} else {\nconsole.log(\"Boo, inline PDFs are not supported by this browser\");} Demo: Detection of PDF support\nPDFObject.pdfobjectversion [property] Returns the version of PDFObject. console.log(PDFObject.pdfobjectversion); //\"2.0.20160402\"\nPDFObject.embed(url [string], target [mixed], options [object]) [method] Returns the embedded element (<embed> for most situations, and <iframe> when integrated with PDF.js), or false if unable to embed. The heart of PDFObject, the embed method provides a ton of functionality and flexibility. See Examples for specific code examples and functioning demos. //embeds a PDF and makes it fill the browser windowPDFObject.embed(\"myfile.pdf\");//embeds a PDF into the element \"my-container\" with no extra options specifiedPDFObject.embed(\"myfile.pdf\", \"#my-container\");//embeds a PDF into the element \"my-container\" with a few options specifiedvar options = {\nheight: \"400px\",\npdfOpenParams: { view: 'FitV', page: '2' }};PDFObject.embed(\"myfile.pdf\", \"#my-container\", options);\nSpecifying a target HTML node The target parameter can accept a CSS selector, HTML node, or jQuery object.//passes a CSS selector to specify the targetPDFObject.embed(\"myfile.pdf\", \"#my-container\");//passes a vanilla HTML node for targetvar mynode = document.getElementById(\"someID\");PDFObject.embed(\"myfile.pdf\", mynode);//passes a jQuery object (HTML node) for targetvar $node = $(\"#someID\");PDFObject.embed(\"myfile.pdf\", $node); \u00a0 Options The options parameter provides a lot of flexibility.\npage [string or number]. Default: null Alias for PDF Open Parameters \"page\" option. Any number entered here will cause the PDF be opened to the specified page number (if the browser supports it). If left unspecified, the PDF will open on page 1.PDFObject.embed(\"myfile.pdf\", \"#my-container\", {page: \"2\"});\nid [string]. Default: null Any string entered here will be appended to the generated <embed> element as the ID. If left unspecified, no ID will be appended.PDFObject.embed(\"myfile.pdf\", \"#my-container\", {id: \"myID\"});//outputs <embed src=\"myfile.pdf\" id=\"myID\">\nwidth [string]. Default: \"100%\" Will insert the width as an inline style via the style attribute on the <embed> element. If left unspecified, PDFObject will default to 100%. Is standard CSS, supports all units, including px, %, em, and rem. Tip: It's safer to specify dimensions using CSS. See \"Specifying dimensions\" below.PDFObject.embed(\"myfile.pdf\", \"#my-container\", {width: \"500px\"});//outputs <embed src=\"myfile.pdf\" style=\"width:500px;\">\nheight [string]. Default: \"100%\" Will insert the height as an inline style via the style attribute on the target element. If left unspecified, PDFObject will default to 100%. Is standard CSS, supports all units, including px, %, em, and rem. Tip: It's safer to specify dimensions using CSS. See \"Specifying dimensions\" below.PDFObject.embed(\"myfile.pdf\", \"#my-container\", {height: \"20rem\"});//outputs <embed src=\"myfile.pdf\" style=\"height:20rem;\">\nfallbackLink [string] or [boolean]. Default: \"<p>This browser does not support inline PDFs. Please download the PDF to view it: <a href='[url]'>Download PDF</a></p>\" Any string entered here will be inserted into the target element when the browser doesn't support inline PDFs.\nHTML is supported Use the shortcode [url] to insert the URL of the PDF (as specified via the URL parameter in the embed() method).var options = {\nfallbackLink: \"<p>This is a <a href='[url]'>fallback link</a></p>\"};PDFObject.embed(\"myfile.pdf\", \"#my-container\", options);//If browser doesn't support inline PDFs, outputs://<p>This is a <a href='myfile.pdf'>fallback link</a></p> Entering false will disable the fallback text option and prevent PDFObject from inserting fallback text\nPDFObject.embed(\"myfile.pdf\", \"#my-container\", {fallbackLink: false});//If browser doesn't support inline PDFs, outputs nothing\npdfOpenParams [object]. Default: null Allows you to specify Adobe's PDF Open Parameters. Warning: These are proprietary and not well supported outside of Adobe products. Most PDF readers support the page parameter, but not much else. PDF.js supports page, zoom, nameddest, and pagemode.\npage is the most widely-supported PDF Open Parameter outside of Adobe products.PDFObject.embed(\"myfile.pdf\", \"#my-container\", {pdfOpenParams: { page: 10 }});//If supported, will cause the PDF viewer to load//the PDF and automatically scroll to page 10\nNote that PDFObject provides a convenient alias for page so you don't need to use the pdfOpenParams child object. All other PDF Open Parameters need to be listed as children of the pdfOpenParams object, as illustrated above.PDFObject.embed(\"myfile.pdf\", \"#my-container\", { page: 10 });//If supported, will cause the PDF viewer to load//the PDF and automatically scroll to page 10\nLearn more about Adobe's PDF Open Parameters Learn more about PDF.js's implementation of PDF Open Parameters\nPDFJS_URL [string]. Default: null If you would like to use PDF.js with PDFObject, you will need to specify the URL of the PDF.js viewer HTML file. PDFObject will automatically append the required querystring to the PDF.js viewer HTML file URL. See the Examples section below for a functioning demo.\nforcePDFJS [boolean]. Default: false If this boolean is set to true and the PDFJS_URL string is not null, PDFObject will attempt to use PDF.js to embed the PDF in the browser, regardless of the browser's default PDF viewer.\n^ Back to top\nGetting Started Here are some of the most common use cases for PDFObject. See the Examples section below for more examples.\nDefault behavior: the full-browser embed\nPDFObject.embed(\"/pdf/sample-3pp.pdf\"); PDFObject.embed(\"/pdf/sample-3pp.pdf\", document.body);\nIf you don't specify a target element, PDFObject will default to document.body, which will cause the PDF to fill the entire browser window. The two examples here have identical functionality. Demo: Full-browser embed (no selector specified) Demo: Full-browser embed (explicit selector)\nSpecifying Dimensions\nPDFObject.embed(\"myfile.pdf\", \"#my-container\");//outputs <embed src=\"myfile.pdf\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%\">\nBy default, PDFObject generates an <embed> element with a width and height of 100%. It will automatically fill the target container.\nvar options = {\nwidth: \"20rem\",\nheight: \"20rem\"};PDFObject.embed(\"myfile.pdf\", \"#my-container\", options);//outputs <embed src=\"myfile.pdf\" style=\"width:20rem;height:20rem\">\nPDFObject allows you to specify dimensions via the options parameter. These dimensions will be appended directly to the <embed> element, as shown here.\n<style>/* Only resize the element if PDF is embedded */.pdfobject-container {\nwidth: 200px;\nheight: 500px;}</style><div id=\"my-container\"></div><script>PDFObject.embed(\"myfile.pdf\", \"#my-container\");</script>\nIf you specify dimensions on the <embed> element directly, you will lose the ability to resize the element via CSS, because the inline styles will always take precedence over the other styles in your file. Therefore it is recommended that you specify dimensions using external CSS rules, as shown here. Note: PDFObject automatically appends the class pdfobject to the <embed> element, and pdfobject-container to the target element. This helps you target your element in CSS. In this example, the dimensions of the target element are only specified if the PDF has been embedded (via the pdfobject-container class). Demo: Embed a PDF and specify dimensions using CSS\nPage number specified\nvar options = {\npage: \"2\"};PDFObject.embed(\"/pdf/sample-3pp.pdf\", \"#my-container\", options);\nAs previously mentioned, most PDF Open Parameters are not widely supported. However, there is one parameter that enjoys wide support: the page parameter. If you specify a page number using the page parameter, as shown in this example, the PDF will auto-scroll to the specified page number.\nAdditional PDF Open Parameters specified\nvar options = {\nheight: \"400px\",\npage: '2',\npdfOpenParams: {\nview: 'FitV',\npagemode: 'thumbs',\nsearch: 'lorem ipsum'\n}};PDFObject.embed(\"/pdf/sample-3pp.pdf\", \"#my-container\", options);\nAs previously mentioned, most PDF Open Parameters are not widely supported. However, there is one parameter that enjoys wide support: the page parameter. If you specify a page number using the page parameter, as shown in this example, the PDF will auto-scroll to the specified page number.\n^ Back to top\nExamples The following links demonstrate the many ways PDFObject can be utilized.\nInvoking conditional JavaScript upon successful embed (onclick)Invoking conditional JavaScript upon successful embedDetection of PDF supportEmbed two PDFs on one HTML pageFull-browser embed (no selector specified)Full-browser embed (explicit selector) with PDF Open Params specifiedFull-browser embed (explicit selector)Passing jQuery element, CSS styles appliedPassing jQuery elementPassing vanilla HTML element, CSS styles appliedPassing vanilla HTML elementPassing CSS selector, CSS styles appliedPassing CSS selectorPDF.js (forced) with querystringPDF.js (forced)PDF.js fallbackSpecifying PDF URL containing querystring, with PDF Open ParametersSpecifying PDF URL containing querystringReplace one PDF with anotherSpecifying custom fallback link\nThe PDFObject utility is \u00a9 2008-2016 Philip Hutchison.

We now have 4,406 articles. We want to reach over 5000 articles.For info on what constitutes \"public domain\", check out the Public Domain FAQ.After Action Comics #1 gave the world Superman in 1938, there was an explosion of costumed heroes in comics. New publishers and characters sprang up everywhere. After World War II, these characters fell out of favor with readers and caused many publishers to go out of business. Those comics and their stars have since entered the public domain, enabling anyone to use those characters and classic stories any way they wish. Over the years, many publishers have taken advantage of this, including AC Comics (FemForce, Men of Mystery), Malibu (The Protectors), America's Best (Terra Obscura), and - most recently - Dynamite (Project Superpowers), and Image Comics (Next Issue Project, Savage Dragon, and Hack/Slash) among others.This is intended to be an online encyclopedia of these characters, providing pertinent information to fans who want to learn about their history, as well as creators who may want to use them. Unless otherwise noted, all images and information are believed to be in the public domain. The information and images presented are intended to give a brief overview of the characters and provide a visual reference.If you have any questions, please contact the administrator: Cebr1979 via his talk page.Enjoy.New on Public Domain Super Heroes\nBill Everett's Bulls-Eye Bill.\nNOW FEATURING OVER 4000 CHARACTERSRecently Added Characters:Allied World ForcesDiana ColbyDinah DeanGool and ZorgArthur HarrisJark HudsonBruce HunterJon Jax, Space AceTommy JordanJoyce LawrenceKlegraMartian BirdmenMusic Makers of AlderbaranMolly O'MooreUnholy 3For a complete list of characters, click here.FEATURED ARTICLE OF THE WEEKTRASHMAN\nTrashman is a hero of the working classes and champion of the radical left causes...

Moreover, various facial traits can give insight into the kind of character that you have.One of these facial traits is our lips. Jean Haner, author of \u201cThe Wisdom of Your Face,\u201d and a face reading expert, thinks that each particular facial feature is linked to some part of your real personality.Haner introduced to the Cosmopolitan that \u201cThe most important thing your lips speak to is [what you\u2019re like] in relationships and how giving you are.\u201dRead on and learn just what your lips can tell about you.Full Top and Bottom Lips.Haner reveals that lip shape can exhibit how much you care about others, and how motherly you are. This who have full upper and bottom lips possess these characteristics in extreme levels.Those will full upper and bottom lips are selfless and love to put others before themselves. \u201cThis person is also someone who wants to have a good circle of friends and a good connection with others,\u201d Haner says. \u201cThey really value relationships.\u201dThin Top and Bottom Lips.\nIf your lips look like these, than you\u2019re not much of an extrovert. You love spending time on your own, and your sense of independence is admirable.\u201cThey don\u2019t naturally speak the language of relationships as well as someone with fuller lips, but it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not good in a relationship,\u201d Haner says.Lips with a Peaked Cupid\u2019s Bow.\u00a0If you have a defined cupid\u2019s bow like Rihanna, then you are a strong communicator, quick-minded and very creative.\u201cBecause they\u2019re so quick-minded, they can also be highly reactive and often not think before speaking,\u201d Haner says. \u201cWhether what they\u2019re saying is kind or mean-spirited.\u201dLips with a Rounded Cupid\u2019s Bow.\u00a0If you have a less sharp and more rounded cupid\u2019s bow, than you are a clean-hearted, genuine individual.\n\u201cThis lip shape points to a person who is extra kind,\u201d Haner says. \u201cThey\u2019re generally more compassionate, take more time with people, and are considerate of others.\u201dLips with an Undefined Cupid\u2019s Bow.If your cupid\u2019s bow lips completely undefined then you are so caring that you lack any emotional boundaries.\u201cThey can be overly giving and be too much of a nurturer and not practice self-care,\u201d says Haner. \u201cThey\u2019re often responsible people, but they have to realize it\u2019s not always their job to take care of the problem.\u201dLips That Are Plumper In the Center.If your lips are naturally fuller in the middle of your upper and lower lips, than you\u2019re an attention getter and you love it.\u201cThey generally like attention, don\u2019t like to be alone, and can be dramatic in relationships,\u201d says Haner. \u201cThe plumpness in the center also can be linked to someone who tends to be more self-indulgence.\u201dNarrow mouth with full lips.Small mouth with full lips means that you prioritize the people you care about, such as he significant other in your relationship.\n\u201cSomeone with a small mouth with thin lips, on the other hand, has the hardest time in relationships because they don\u2019t have a strong need for a connection with others,\u201d Haner says.No Upper Lip with a Normal Lower Lip.\u00a0If you have an extremely thin upper lip and a normal sized bottom lip than you very much value work and achieving your goals over any relationship.\u201cThey may have difficulty in relationships and they don\u2019t relax very well,\u201d says Haner. \u201cBecause to them, life is about getting somewhere. Sixty percent of men have a mouth like this.\u201dLarger Mouth with Normal to Full Lips.\u00a0If you have normal lips but a wide smile than you\u2019re known for your generosity, and desire to help other individuals. You always think of others first.\u201cA person with a large mouth and thin lips, on the other hand, isn\u2019t as giving or always thinking about others,\u201d says Haner.\u201cGoldilocks\u201d Lips.\nThis term addresses those individuals who have lips that are neither thick or thin, just an average size without any extremely defined features.Haner says that these people are \u201ceven-kneeled in relationships.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll do just fine and won\u2019t go overboard when it comes to drama or giving too much. You\u2019re not needy or clingy, but you do crave a sense of connection in relationships.\u201dShare: Read MoreWoman goes out by jumping into a pit with 1,000 crocodiles!

Please chime in on the subject if you feel strongly on it.\n(10/2/06) I have gotten a few emails on why I changed the way that clothing and furniture are priced from a tt+ model to a total price model. This is because these items do not decay. You can use them forever without them ever going bad. So a couch in your apartment looks and works the same weather it is in good or poor condition. You don't care what the tt value is on the couch, you just want a couch. Why would you pay more for it at auction if it has a higher tt?\n(10/2/06) Added the little info box on weapons and armor for a ton of pages that did not have this yet.\n(9/30/06) Because items such as furniture and clothing can be used without decay, it makes sense to not think of the price as a TT+ value but as a total price. This has been reflected on the site. I have also moved items around and rethought most of the site. Furthermore, a link has been added from each crafted item to the corresponding BP page.\n(9/23-24/06) Hackers attack! This weekend was completely shot due to some hackers with a political message. It took me 35 straight hours(no sleep) to rebuild the server.

An estimated 1.5 million people\nvisit Pearl Harbor every year to pay their\nrespects to those who perished on this \u201cday that will live in infamy\u201d and to\nlearn about an important part of world history. This website offers varied\ninformation for Pearl Harbor enthusiasts, as\nwell as for those who are planning a trip to the monument. For an historical\noverview, site visitors might begin by reading the detailed account of \u201cWhat Happened\u201d\non December 7, 1941.\nUnder this tab, guests can also find a comprehensive list of those brave men\nwho lost their lives in Pearl Harbor. In World War II, U.S.\nbattleships were like men \u2013 like indefatigable soldiers who were endowed with\nskills, flawed, wounded, patched up and returned to war. These battleships,\nlike men, served their country with valor and unflagging commitment. Like men,\nthey often died in combat and sometimes went in for surgery and emerged\nstronger and better than ever before. The \u201cBattleships\u201d link on this site\noffers the detailed narratives of all ten battleships that were engaged in\nWorld War II efforts. Each story reveals a unique perspective of a \u201csoldier\u201d\nfrom life to death and gives an historical glimpse into the U.S. Navy and its\nconstantly changing capabilities and technologies. After the battleships were\nlaunched, after brave men risked and lost their lives to protect American soil\nand after the war ended, Pearl Harbor\nremained. Today it stands as a symbolic reference to a nation\u2019s past. Almost 70\nyears have passed since that infamous day, and the face of Pearl\nHarbor has changed a great deal in that time. Visitors can click\nthe \u201cToday\u201d tab to read about how the memorial came to be built and the kinds\nof efforts that were required to ensure the site would be preserved and open to\nthe public. The \u201cVisit\u201d tab on this website is\nan excellent time-saving resource that gives current, up-to-date information\nabout all you need to know to plan a fruitful trip to Pearl\nHarbor.\u00a0 Here guests can\nfind directions to the memorial, as well as details about entrance fees, hours\nof operation and security and precautionary measures. Perhaps most useful of\nall are the descriptions of the memorial and nearby attractions and activities,\nso that visitors can begin to plan a sample itinerary that will ensure their\ntime at Pearl Harbor is well-spent.\nParticular points of interest that\nvisitors will not want to miss include the USS Arizona Memorial, the USS\nMissouri battleship, the USS Bowfin Submarine Museum and the Pearl Harbor\nmuseum, visitor\u2019s center and gift shop.\nHome About Privacy Policy Terms\n\u00a9 2009 - 2017 PearlHarborInHawaii.com\nThis site is also available in German", "mostFrequentWord": "harbor", "topic4": 1, "topImportantWord": "TODO!!!!", "id": 531, "topic12": 1}, {"lang": "en", "topic8": 4, "topic2": 1, "url": "http://www.pebbleplace.com/", "text": "PEBBLE PLACE\nHOME - Photographs, Camera Equipment Reviews, Lens Databases & More\nHOME\nREVIEWS Rangefinder SLR Medium Format Accessories\nGEAR TALK\nLEICA db\nCONTAX db\nPICTURES By Destination By Portrait By Texas Location By RF Lens By SLR Lens By 645 Lens\nRECENT UPDATES & NEWS\nUpdated April 22, 2017\nLEICA SF-40 AND THE LEICA M MONOCHROM TYP 246 GEAR TALK - Saturday, April 22, 2017 My attempt to understand the Leica TTL flash system with the Leica M Monochrom Typ 246 and Leica SF-40 flash. \u00a0Read more\nUPDATES, UPDATES AND UPDATES REVIEW UPDATES - March 11, 2017 There are have been a number of review updates during the past month - \u00a0Leica 75mm F2 Summicron-M APO Review - Updated / Expanded, Zeiss 50mm F2 Makro-Planar ZE Review - Rewrite and Zeiss 100mm F2 Makro-Planar ZE Review - Total Rewrite.\nSLOW AND STEADY GEAR TALK - Sunday, February 12, 2017 Staying the course with the Leica M Monochrom Typ 246 and weighing out the color camera options. \u00a0Read more\nLEICA 35MM F1.4 SUMMILUX-M ASPH REVIEW UPDATE - Monday, January 9, 2017 The lens review updates continue with the Leica 35mm F1.4 Summilux-M ASPH being the latest to get its content updated and the layout refreshed.

If you are like most people coming to PEERtrainer for the first time, you main efforts in losing weight have focused on the quantity of food eaten, rather than the quality of the food. From our perspective and experience, the types of food that you eat matter tremendously when determining whether weight loss will be easy or hard, or achievable at all. If you are new to PEERtrainer, the very first thing we'd like you to do is download a copy of our free Cheat System. You can get your copy here. After you download it, we would like you to read it. It won't take long, but it will give you a very simple way of making better decisions. Most importantly, you can't fail at the Cheat System. You do as much or as little as you like. It has two lists of foods. One list contains foods to eat as much of as you like, which will help you in your weight loss efforts. The other list contains foods that you want to move away from over time or minimize more than you currently are.\nTake your first step towards a healthier life.\nJoin Now For Free\nAdvertise With Us\nContact Us\nContact Us\nFollow us on facebook\n**New PEERtrainer Articles, Guides, Blog Posts and Programs:\nDoes Meat Cause Cancer?

This trial version will allow potential users to try the software before they buy a license.In 2008 I launched my first commercial Excel add-in, Peltier Tech Waterfall Chart Utility. All it did was make waterfall charts. Over the years I made improvements and enhancements to the waterfall chart utility, and I introduced (and improved and enhanced) other chart types. In 2013 I merged them together into Peltier Tech Chart Utility 2.00, and added a bunch of other chart-related features. In 2015 I released a major upgrade, Peltier Tech Charts for Excel 3.0, which extended compatibility to Excel 2016 (including Office 365), allowed the same add-in to be used on Mac and Windows computers, and added features and improvements.In Excel 2016, by the way, Microsoft has finally introduced their own Waterfall Chart as a built-in chart type, but mine is way better, with more options and features.All this sounds great, but people want to actually try something before they spend their hard-earned cash. So the demo will have all of the features of the Advanced Edition of the software, and it will work for 15 days after installation. There will be a minimum of notices about the demo status of the software, because those suck.Of course,\u00a0making a demo is a huge undertaking. I have to make sure it shows off all the features of the software, but only for a limited time, so I can stay in business. So my demo is actually a beta test of a demo. I need some feedback from serious potential users so I can assess the effectiveness of the demo.Here\u2019s how it will work. The first 15 people who comment below with their email address will get a return email containing a link to the demo. The link will only work once for each user, so don\u2019t go sharing it. I\u2019ll remove your email address from your post as soon as I respond so you won\u2019t risk getting spammed.I would like\u00a0these testers to install the demo, test it out, and give me feedback, both about the regular features and about the way the demo works. I\u2019m interested in the answers to questions like these:Does being a demo limit the features in ways I hadn\u2019t noticed?Does the demo expire when expected?Are the notices helpful and not bothersome?In exchange for this vital feedback, I will offer a $20 discount to these testers, so they will be able to purchase an Advanced license for the price of the Standard.Edit 1I\u2019ve got the fifteen volunteers to test out the demo. After I get some feedback from these good folks, I\u2019ll make the demo generally available.Edit 2I\u2019ve gotten\u00a0some great feedback, suggestions, and bug reports; most of this relates to the program itself, not the demo version. I\u2019ve been working furiously to fix bugs and implement other enhancements. Stay tuned.Posted: Wednesday, March 22nd, 2017 under Utilities.Tags: demo.

A CSV (Comma-Separated-Value) file is a simple text file, with each row being a record, and the field values within each record are separated by commas; often the first row contains field names. Excel can open CSV files readily enough, and then you can work with the data like any worksheet data. But if you receive a lot of these files, it might be nice to have a\u00a0VBA routine that will handle them for you.A while back I wrote a couple of posts that showed how to plot data from\u00a0CSV files (see links at end of this article). A reader had some issues implementing those techniques. They were complex approaches, one contained\u00a0a dialog for the user to select columns to plot and the other was a full-blown add-in. I realized that I didn\u2019t have a good introductory tutorial for opening and processing CSV files, so here it is.I\u2019ll start with a simple routine that opens a CSV file, saves it as an Excel workbook, then plots all the data in the file, letting Excel use whatever defaults it sees fit. Then I\u2019ll show a few variations, to help you figure out how to work with your own special data.Here is a zipped Excel workbook that contains all of this code, with buttons on the worksheet to run each routine. The zip file also contains a folder with a number of dummy CSV files.VBA_Routines_to_Process_CSV_Files.zipSimple CSV File \u2013 Open and Chart All CSV DataI\u2019ll use this simple CSV data. It has headers in the first row, X values in the first column, and Y values in the next three columns. Of course it doesn\u2019t look like columns, since the values are separated by commas. But when opened in Excel, the data will be placed into columns.The code has to do these things:Open the CSV fileInsert an XY Scatter chartPopulate the chart with the applicable dataSave the file with its chart as an Excel workbookAnd here\u2019s the simple code:Sub CSV_OpenAndChart_1()\n' declare variables\nDim sCSVFile As String\nDim sWorkbook As String\nDim ws As Worksheet\nDim cht As Chart\n' hard-coded CSV filename\nsCSVFile = \"C:\\csv_data\\csv_data_1.csv\"\n' workbook name: strip off everything after last \".\" and add \"xlsx\" extension\nsWorkbook = Left$(sCSVFile, InStrRev(sCSVFile, \".\")) & \"xlsx\"\n' open CSV file\nWorkbooks.Open sCSVFile\n' assign variables\nSet ws = ActiveSheet\n' insert and populate chart\nSet cht = ws.Shapes.AddChart2(240, xlXYScatterLines).Chart\ncht.SetSourceData Source:=ws.Range(\"$A$1:$D$8\"), PlotBy:=xlColumns\n' move chart to left, under data, and make it smaller\nWith cht.Parent\n.Left = 10\n.Top = ws.Range(\"$A$1:$D$8\").Height + 10\n.Width = 275\n.Height = 200\nEnd With\n' save as Excel Workbook\nActiveWorkbook.SaveAs sWorkbook, xlWorkbookDefault\nEnd SubAfter the code runs, here\u2019s what the Excel worksheet looks like. The data up at the top is no longer comma-separated, it\u2019s arranged into rows and columns. And the chart is right below the end of the data.ImprovementsBefore you\u00a0even customize the code to accommodate any special features of your data, there are a couple of tricks that you ought to know about.FileDialogFilePickerIn our procedure, the file name is hard-coded. I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t have to say why that\u2019s a bad idea, except to say that you\u2019re making a huge assumption that you\u2019ve typed in the only file name that you\u2019re ever going to need. And if the file isn\u2019t there, well\u2026And you can\u2019t just tell your users to type in a new file name in the code, because\u00a0you can\u2019t trust that they won\u2019t break the code.Using the file dialog isn\u2019t much more difficult than hard-coding the file name. You need a few more variables and a few more lines of code:\n' declare variables\nDim fd As FileDialog\nDim fdSelected As FileDialogSelectedItems\nDim sInitial As String\nDim sCurDir As String\nDim sCSVFile As String\n' initial folder to open in dialog\n' if file name included, it is preselected\nsInitial = \"C:\\csv_data\\csv_data_1.csv\"\nsCurDir = CurDir\n' create the dialog\nSet fd = Application.FileDialog(msoFileDialogFilePicker)\nWith fd\n' apply dialog settings\n.AllowMultiSelect = False\n.InitialFileName = sInitial\n.Filters.Clear\n.Filters.Add \"CSV Files\", \"*.csv\", 1\n.Title = \"Select CSV File\"\n' show the dialog\n' .Show returns -1 if Open, 0 if Cancel\nIf .Show = 0 Then GoTo Exit_Procedure\n' get the selected file\nSet fdSelected = .SelectedItems\nsCSVFile = fdSelected(1)\nEnd With\n' clean up\nSet fdSelected = Nothing\nSet fd = Nothing\nExit_Procedure:\nChDrive sCurDir\nChDir sCurDirUsedRangeIn the code, we can assign the value of a range variable as follows:\nDim rUsed As Range\nSet rUsed = ws.UsedRangeThe used range of a worksheet is the rectangular region that encloses all of the data. In our example, it\u2019s A1:E8. Using UsedRange means I don\u2019t need to know the address of the data range, and I don\u2019t need to count how many rows or columns are in the data, I can just pass the used range to the chart.Suppose my CSV data had more columns. My code using UsedRange doesn\u2019t care, since it uses the whole used range of data in the file. The following starts with a CSV file with six columns instead of four, and all of the Y value columns are plotted.AddChart2In the procedure above I used the following to insert the chart:\nSet cht = ws.Shapes.AddChart2(240, xlXYScatterLines).ChartHow did I know to use AddChart2? I can never\u00a0remember the exact syntax, so I opened the CSV file and recorded a macro while I inserted the chart, and this is what the Macro Recorder recorded. That\u2019s fine, AddChart2 gives us the nicely formatted charts which were introduced in Excel 2013. The 240 inside the brackets tell Excel to apply style 240, and of course xlXYScatterlines is the chart type. But Excel 2007 and 2010 don\u2019t understand AddChart2: you\u2019ll get a compile error, and Excel won\u2019t even run any of the procedure. For these earlier versions of Excel, we need to use this code:\nSet cht = ws.Shapes.AddChart(xlXYScatterLines).ChartNo style number, and you end up with the uglier default formatting, Even in Excel 2013 or 2016. For reference, the output of Excel 2007 and 2010\u2019s AddChart is shown as the top chart below, with the output of Excel 2013 and 2016\u2019s AddChart2 as the bottom chart below.So how do you write code that does not crash in Excel 2007 and 2010, but still provides the nice chart styles of Excel 2013 and 2016? Excel 2013 and 2016 still can use AddChart, even though the preferred syntax is AddChart2, but you\u2019ll get the uglier old formats. You can\u2019t apply style 240 in the earlier releases, because it will not be recognized. So you need to test for Excel version, and apply the style in later versions.\nSet cht = ws.Shapes.AddChart(xlXYScatterLines).Chart\nIf Val(Application.Version) > 14 Then\ncht.ChartStyle = 240\nEnd IfApplication.Version returns a text string, for example, \u201c12.0\u201d for Excel 2007 or \u201c16.0\u201d for Excel 2016. We need to convert the string to a numerical value; this happens automatically if your system uses a period as a decimal separator, but it misbehaves if it expects a comma.

What if the first column of the CSV file is some kind of index or description. If we try to plot it, we will get a messy chart. So we want to skip the first column; using similar logic you can skip the first three columns, or the third column, or whatever data you don\u2019t want in your chart.Here\u2019s a CSV file like the one used above, but the first column is an index.We\u2019ll build on the previous routine, with its file dialog and AddChart/ChartStyle approach, and we\u2019ll modify the chart data range.Sub CSV_OpenAndChart_2A_SkipFirstColumn()\n' declare variables\nDim fd As FileDialog\nDim fdSelected As FileDialogSelectedItems\nDim sInitial As String\nDim sCurDir As String\nDim sCSVFile As String\nDim sWorkbook As String\nDim ws As Worksheet\nDim rUsed As Range\nDim cht As Chart\n' variables to help modify chart data range\nDim nRows As Long, nCols As Long\nDim rChart As Range\n' initial folder to open in dialog\n' if file name included, it is preselected\nsInitial = \"C:\\csv_data\\csv_data_2.csv\"\nsCurDir = CurDir\n' create the dialog\nSet fd = Application.FileDialog(msoFileDialogFilePicker)\nWith fd\n' apply dialog settings\n.AllowMultiSelect = False\n.InitialFileName = sInitial\n.Filters.Clear\n.Filters.Add \"CSV Files\", \"*.csv\", 1\n.Title = \"Select CSV File\"\n' show the dialog\n' .Show returns -1 if Open, 0 if Cancel\nIf .Show = 0 Then GoTo Exit_Procedure\n' get the selected file\nSet fdSelected = .SelectedItems\nEnd With\nsCSVFile = fdSelected(1)\nsWorkbook = Left$(sCSVFile, InStrRev(sCSVFile, \".\")) & \"xlsx\"\n' open CSV file\nWorkbooks.Open sCSVFile\n' assign variables\nSet ws = ActiveSheet\nSet rUsed = ws.UsedRange\n' modified data range\nnRows = rUsed.Rows.Count\nnCols = rUsed.Columns.Count\nSet rChart = rUsed.Offset(, 1).Resize(, nCols - 1)\n' syntax for 2007-2010-2013-2016\nSet cht = ws.Shapes.AddChart(xlXYScatterLines).Chart\nIf Val(Application.Version) > 14 Then\ncht.ChartStyle = 240\nEnd If\ncht.SetSourceData Source:=rChart, PlotBy:=xlColumns\n' move chart to left, under data, and make it smaller\nWith cht.Parent\n.Left = 10\n.Top = rUsed.Height + 10\n.Width = 275\n.Height = 200\nEnd With\n' save as Excel Workbook\nActiveWorkbook.SaveAs sWorkbook, xlWorkbookDefault\nExit_Procedure:\nChDrive sCurDir\nChDir sCurDir\nEnd SubAfter the code is run, the new workbook looks like the following. The chart is selected, and you can see that the first column of data is not highlighted as part of the chart\u2019s data range.CSV Data Structure: Combine Date and Time Columns into Chart-Friendly Date-TimeThe previous data treatment was pretty easy. What if, instead of a nice column of X values, we have a column of dates and another column of times. To review quickly, Excel treats a date as a whole number (the number of days since 1-Jan-1900, give or take an erroneous leap day, but that\u2019s another story, and it\u2019s not even Microsoft\u2019s fault), and it treats a time as a fraction (the fraction of 24 hours that has elapsed since the previous midnight). You can\u2019t plot by separate date and time values, but if you add them together you get a date-time value that can be treated as a numerical value on the X axis of a scatter chart.So we need to insert a new column, and add the dates and times to get chart-ready date-time values. Here is a sample, shown for simpliciy in a worksheet rather than in a text file reader. Like the previous data set, the first column is an index which will be ignored by the chart. Columns B and C are the dates and times which must be combined in a new column inserted after column C.Sub CSV_OpenAndChart_3A_CombineDateTime()\n' declare variables\nDim fd As FileDialog\nDim fdSelected As FileDialogSelectedItems\nDim sInitial As String\nDim sCurDir As String\nDim sCSVFile As String\nDim sWorkbook As String\nDim ws As Worksheet\nDim rUsed As Range\nDim cht As Chart\n' variables to help modify chart data range\nDim nRows As Long, nCols As Long\nDim rChart As Range\n' initial folder to open in dialog\n' if file name included, it is preselected\nsInitial = \"C:\\csv_data\\csv_data_3.csv\"\nsCurDir = CurDir\n' create the dialog\nSet fd = Application.FileDialog(msoFileDialogFilePicker)\nWith fd\n' apply dialog settings\n.AllowMultiSelect = False\n.InitialFileName = sInitial\n.Filters.Clear\n.Filters.Add \"CSV Files\", \"*.csv\", 1\n.Title = \"Select CSV File\"\n' show the dialog\n' .Show returns -1 if Open, 0 if Cancel\nIf .Show = 0 Then GoTo Exit_Procedure\n' get the selected file\nSet fdSelected = .SelectedItems\nEnd With\nsCSVFile = fdSelected(1)\nsWorkbook = Left$(sCSVFile, InStrRev(sCSVFile, \".\")) & \"xlsx\"\n' open CSV file\nWorkbooks.Open sCSVFile\n' assign variables\nSet ws = ActiveSheet\nSet rUsed = ws.UsedRange\n' insert column to combine date (column 2) with time (column 3)\nws.Columns(4).Insert xlToRight\nSet rUsed = ws.UsedRange\nnRows = rUsed.Rows.Count\nnCols = rUsed.Columns.Count\nWith rUsed.Columns(4).Offset(1).Resize(nRows - 1)\n.Formula = \"=B2+C2\"\n.NumberFormat = \"m/d/yyyy h:mm\"\nEnd With\nSet rChart = rUsed.Offset(, 3).Resize(, nCols - 3)\n' syntax for 2007-2010-2013-2016\nSet cht = ws.Shapes.AddChart(xlXYScatterLines).Chart\nIf Val(Application.Version) > 14 Then\ncht.ChartStyle = 240\nEnd If\ncht.SetSourceData Source:=rChart, PlotBy:=xlColumns\n' format axis tick labels\ncht.Axes(xlCategory).TickLabels.NumberFormat = \"m/d\"\n' move chart to left, under data, and make it smaller\nWith cht.Parent\n.Left = 10\n.Top = rUsed.Height + 10\n.Width = 275\n.Height = 200\nEnd With\n' save as Excel Workbook\nActiveWorkbook.SaveAs sWorkbook, xlWorkbookDefault\nExit_Procedure:\nChDrive sCurDir\nChDir sCurDir\nEnd SubMultiple CSV Files, Processed SeparatelyIf you get a dozen CSV files all at once, you could run the code a dozen times, selecting each file in turn. But wouldn\u2019t it be better to select all the files in one trip to the file dialog, then let the code run all of the files?You may have noticed the AllowMultiSelect property of the file dialog, and that we set its value to False. We can set this property to True, and the dialog will allow us to select multiple files using the Shift or Ctrl key as we\u2019re used to. Each selected file will be a member of the file dialog\u2019s SelectedItems. We can wrap the file-processing code in a For-Next loop to process each file in turn.Note that if you select one file in the dialog, this routine will process that one file just fine.Sub CSV_OpenAndChart_4A_MultipleFiles()\n' declare variables\nDim fd As FileDialog\nDim fdSelected As FileDialogSelectedItems\nDim sInitial As String\nDim sCurDir As String\nDim sCSVFile As String\nDim sWorkbook As String\nDim ws As Worksheet\nDim rUsed As Range, rChart As Range\nDim cht As Chart\nDim nRows As Long, nCols As Long\n' file counters\nDim iFile As Long, nFiles As Long\n' initial folder to open in dialog\n' if file name included, it is preselected\nsInitial = \"C:\\csv_data\\\"\nsCurDir = CurDir\n' create the dialog\nSet fd = Application.FileDialog(msoFileDialogFilePicker)\nWith fd\n' apply dialog settings\n.AllowMultiSelect = True\n.InitialFileName = sInitial\n.Filters.Clear\n.Filters.Add \"CSV Files\", \"*.csv\", 1\n.Title = \"Select CSV File\"\n' show the dialog\n' .Show returns -1 if Open, 0 if Cancel\nIf .Show = 0 Then GoTo Exit_Procedure\n' get the selected file\nSet fdSelected = .SelectedItems\nnFiles = fdSelected.Count\nEnd With\n' do all the files\nFor iFile = 1 To nFiles\nsCSVFile = fdSelected(iFile)\nsWorkbook = Left$(sCSVFile, InStrRev(sCSVFile, \".\")) & \"xlsx\"\n' open CSV file\nWorkbooks.Open sCSVFile\n' assign variables\nSet ws = ActiveSheet\nSet rUsed = ws.UsedRange\n' insert column to combine date (column 2) with time (column 3)\nws.Columns(4).Insert xlToRight\nSet rUsed = ws.UsedRange\nnRows = rUsed.Rows.Count\nnCols = rUsed.Columns.Count\nWith rUsed.Columns(4).Offset(1).Resize(nRows - 1)\n.Formula = \"=B2+C2\"\n.NumberFormat = \"m/d/yyyy h:mm\"\nEnd With\nSet rChart = rUsed.Offset(, 3).Resize(, nCols - 3)\n' syntax for 2007-2010-2013-2016\nSet cht = ws.Shapes.AddChart(xlXYScatterLines).Chart\nIf Val(Application.Version) > 14 Then\ncht.ChartStyle = 240\nEnd If\ncht.SetSourceData Source:=rChart, PlotBy:=xlColumns\n' format axis tick labels\ncht.Axes(xlCategory).TickLabels.NumberFormat = \"m/d\"\n' move chart to left, under data, and make it smaller\nWith cht.Parent\n.Left = 10\n.Top = rUsed.Height + 10\n.Width = 275\n.Height = 200\nEnd With\n' save as Excel Workbook\nActiveWorkbook.SaveAs sWorkbook, xlWorkbookDefault\nActiveWorkbook.Close\nNext\nExit_Procedure:\nChDrive sCurDir\nChDir sCurDir\nEnd SubMultiple CSV Files, Combined Into One Output WorkbookThe final variation I\u2019ll talk about here is processing multiple CSV files (and it works with just one CSV file), and placing each output worksheet into one output workbook; the worksheet tabs will reflect the names of the input CSV files.

Comments: 3\nExcel Books Friday, February 3, 2017\nby Jon Peltier Peltier Technical Services, Inc., Copyright \u00a9 2017.\nOften when I\u2019m working with someone, showing off my Excel tricks, I am\u00a0asked, \u201cHow do you know all that stuff?\u201d And the answer is simple: I\u2019ve been using Excel for around 25 years, Excel charts for all that time, and Excel VBA for 20 years. There\u2019s a combination of natural curiosity (\u201cwhat does this button do\u201d and \u201chow do I do that\u201d), and reading manuals (in the days before online help), and becoming good at Google. And there are a thousand Excel books that claim to teach you everything about Excel.A small selection of my Excel book collection. My copy of RibbonX is falling apart!I\u2019ve decided to\u00a0put together a list of good Excel books, to make it easy for people to find these resources. This is not a comprehensive list of all Excel books. Instead, it is a list of some of the\u00a0books that I have found helpful. I know most of the authors of these books, but I also know authors of books not included here. Books not listed are not omitted because they are bad, necessarily, but just because I am limiting the size of this article.A couple authors may seem overrepresented here. Both are comprehensive in their approach, and they cover a range of topics and levels of difficulty. John \u201cMr Spreadsheet\u201d Walkenbach has been writing about spreadsheets since before Excel was a thing, and for each version of Excel that is released, there is a family of Mr Spreadsheet books on an array of topics. You really can\u2019t go wrong with one of the Mr Spreadsheet family of books. John doesn\u2019t do all of the writing anymore, but he has enlisted knowledgeable co-authors to maintain the tradition. Bill \u201cMr Excel\u201d Jelen runs the best Excel forum in the known universe and has his own popular series of Excel books. I know both of these experts, and I like their books. Like John, Bill also has used experts to help with the writing tasks.I may expand this list in the future, maybe to add books to the existing categories, but mostly to add more categories. For example, I have not listed any books that discuss the new data technologies\u00a0of Excel\u00a0(Power Pivot etc.). For now I will concentrate on general Excel topics, VBA, and charting. Note that the links here are all Amazon Affiliate links, so if you purchase any\u00a0of these Excel books, I will\u00a0get a small commission.General Excel Books \u00a0 Excel 2016 Bible\u00a0by John Walkenbach\u00a0\u2013 This is the most comprehensive, and heaviest, Excel book you will find anywhere. It covers everything about Excel in extensive detail. Formulas, charting, data analysis, formatting, and programming.Learn Excel 2007 through Excel 2010 From MrExcel\u00a0by Bill Jelen \u2013\u00a0While not as extensive as the Excel Bible, this is a very good all-around resource.Excel Formulas, etc.\nExcel 2016 Formulas\u00a0by Michael Alexander and Dick Kusleika \u2013 If the Excel Bible was so comprehensive, then why did John Walkenbach need a book about Excel formulas?\u00a0This book\u00a0covers formulas in more depth, formulas in defined Names, formulas in Conditional Formatting, financial formulas, array formulas, and user defined functions that use VBA.Ctrl+Shift+Enter \u2013 Mastering Excel Array Formulas\u00a0by Mike \u201cExcel Is Fun\u201d Girvin \u2013 Mike\u00a0turns you on to the magic of array formulas in this book, with the same irreverent approach as you\u2019ve seen in the popular ExcelIsFun YouTube channel.Excel Tables: A Complete Guide for Creating, Using and Automating Lists and Tables by Zach Baresse and Kevin Jones \u2013 This book takes away the mystery of Tables (a/k/a Lists, the best feature introduced in Excel 2003), and helps you with filtering and sorting, using Tables\u2019 structured references, and much more.Excel Pivot Tables\nExcel 2016 Pivot Table Data Crunching\u00a0by Bill Jelen and Michael Alexander \u2013 A comprehensive volume about\u00a0building, formatting, and modifying pivot tables, with sections on Power Query for working with your input data, and VBA for automating the finished product.Beginning PivotTables in Excel 2007: From Novice to Professional\u00a0by Debra Dalgleish and\u00a0Excel 2007 PivotTables Recipes: A Problem-Solution Approach\u00a0by Debra Dalgleish \u2013 Two books from my favorite pivot table expert, the first with beginner to expert coverage, and the second with many helpful examples to get you started or get you over the hump.Excel VBA Books\nExcel 2016 Power Programming with VBA\u00a0by Michael Alexander and Dick Kusleika \u2013 This book starts with recording macros, progresses through cleaning up recorded code, and leads to designing and writing your own code. It teaches about the tools built into the VB Editor, and covers topics like application and add-in development, VBA language features, and UserForms (custom dialogs).Excel 2016 VBA and Macros\u00a0by Bill Jelen and Tracy Syrstad \u2013 This is another extensive volume about using VBA in Excel. It covers macros, VBA-enhanced workbooks, and full-blown add-in applications.RibbonX: Customizing the Office 2007 Ribbon\u00a0by Robert Martin, Ken Puls, and Teresa Hennig \u2013 If your VBA project needs a user interface, this book is required reading.\u00a0This is the book I still use the most; the cover has fallen off and a few pages are loose. It covers all you need to know about the XML code that drives the Microsoft Office ribbon, and about the VBA that supports the XML.Professional Excel Development: The Definitive Guide to Developing Applications Using Microsoft Excel, VBA, and .NET (2nd Edition)\u00a0by Rob Bovey, Dennis Wallentin, Stephen Bullen, and John Green \u2013 When you are ready to create commercial quality add-ins, this book picks up from the others, and makes you a pro. Chapters on dictator applications,\u00a0Windows APIs, error handling,\u00a0controlling other Office programs, and localization give you things you can\u2019t find anywhere else.Excel Charting Books\nExcel 2007 Charts\u00a0by John Walkenbach and\u00a0Excel 2013 Charts and Graphs\u00a0by Bill Jelen \u2013 These books cover the basic charting\u00a0topics, such as how to create a chart, chart types, chart data, and formatting. They work through advanced topics, such as statistics, pivot charts, and best practices. And they finish with detailed sections about automating charts with VBA.Creating More Effective Graphs\u00a0by Naomi Robbins \u2013 This is not an Excel book, but it provides great insights into how to present your data effectively.Data at Work: Best practices for creating effective charts and information graphics in Microsoft Excel\u00a0by Jorge Camoes \u2013 This is the Excel charting book that I would have liked to have written. Jorge has applied the best practices of data visualization to charting in Excel.Excel Dashboards\nExcel Dashboards and Reports for Dummies\u00a0by Michael Alexander \u2013 Yes, a Dummies book, and no, I\u2019m not crazy. This was the first book about Excel dashboards, and Mike did a good job of staying within the Dummies framework but providing lots of useful information.Excel Dashboards and Reports\u00a0by Michael Alexander and John Walkenbach \u2013 This advanced volume builds on Mike\u2019s successful Dummies book, with more details about working with data and making effective visual reports.Dashboards for Excel\u00a0by Jordan Goldmeier and Purnachandra \u201cChandoo\u201d Duggirala \u2013 In addition to applying data visualization practices and dynamic formulas and charts, this book digs into Power Query, Power Pivot, and the Excel Data Model to make robust and elaborate dashboards.Posted: Friday, February 3rd, 2017 under Books.Tags: .

The portrait was commisioned by Sikh Lens and presented to the family of Bhagat Singh Thind at Chapman university in orange county USA.Bhagat Singh Thind (October 3, 1892 \u2013 September 15, 1967) was an Indian-American Sikh writer, scientist and a lecturer on spirituality who was involved in an important legal battle over the rights of Indians to obtain U.S. citizenship.Thind had enlisted in the U.S. Army a few months before the end of World War I. After the war he sought the right to become a naturalized citizen, following a legal ruling that Caucasians had access to such rights. In 1923, a crucial Supreme Court case United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind was decided in favor of the United States, retroactively denying all Indian-Americans born abroad citizenship for not being a White person \"in accordance with the understanding of the common man.\"[1]However, Thind remained in the U.S., completed his PhD, and delivered lectures in metaphysics. Basing his lessons on Sikh religious philosophy, he added to his teaching with references to the scriptures of several religions and the works of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Walt Whitman, and Henry David Thoreau. He campaigned actively for the independence of India from the British Empire. Then, in 1936, Thind applied for and received U.S. citizenship through the state of New York\nLoading...\nView All\nAdd to Favourites\nView deviation\nEdit Watch Settings\nUnwatch Pen-Tacular-Artist\nNov 10, 2016 Pen-Tacular-Artist submitted a deviation\n'Light at the end of the tunnel'\nGraphite and Charcoal drawing titled 'Light at the end of the tunnel'. Which is my fourth completed large A1 (594x841mm) drawing and took about 115 hours over 16 days to complete. Although this drawing is open to interpretation and people can take from it what they like. The reasoning behind it is actually quite specific and is really about \u2018depression\u2019. I have suffered from depression for as long as I can remember, and although I am ok now, for a long time I was in a really dark and suicidal place.\nLuckily I managed to get help and started drawing again 4 years ago which helped me break out of my depression. Unfortunately for allot of people, especially men, talking about their issues and problems is very difficult. Which is why the highest reason for male deaths, is from suicide.\nSo this drawing is trying to convey how I felt when I was depressed. As although everyone is laughing there is a man in the middle of the drawing who is not, this is supposed to represent me. And the dark clouds are meant to represent the depression trying to overcoming me. And the reason why everyone is laughing is because one of the things I've always hated, especially when depressed, was when people would laugh hysterically. As I have hardly ever laughed hysterically, so it\u2019s something that I have always had a hard time understanding. This is due to the fact then when I was severely depressed, I could not understand why others were so happy. As I had a warped version of reality, where I thought everyone else was having a great time and had amazing lives, while I was miserable. Obviously, now looking back I know that is not true, as everyone has problems and lots of people suffer silently with depression.\nAlthough this drawing is about depression it is not just doom and gloom and has a positive side. As someone who has been through years of depression, one thing I can say is that depression does not last forever. So the dark clouds that are representing depression, in my artwork, is slowly starting to disperse and a ray of light is shining through and beating back the dark clouds of depression. And i hope by me being so open about my struggles and how I overcame my battle with depression, that others can see that the dark black hole that they think they are there in, is not real. And that if they persevere and get help that there is \u2018light at the end of the tunnel\u2019.\nLoading...\nView All\nAdd to Favourites\nView deviation\nEdit Watch Settings\nUnwatch Pen-Tacular-Artist\nNov 4, 2016 Pen-Tacular-Artist submitted a deviation\n'DELILAH'\nGraphite and Charcoal drawing titled 'Delilah'.

Which Is my second completed large A1 (594x841mm) drawing and took about 115 hours over 16 days to complete and is the first piece i ve done on animal cruelty for over a year. This particular drawing is quite subtle and may not be obvious that its about animal cruelty at first. As initially it just seems like a women looking through blinds and crying. But on closer inspection you can see in the reflection of her eyes, with pigs being hung upside down and slaughtered at a slaughterhouse. Being a vegetarian my entire life (trying to become a vegan) I have always found peoples disconnect and relationship with animals and meat very disturbing. As I feel people just completely ignore how much suffering and trauma animals go through so that they can have a meal on there plate. Except when they have an emotional connection to the animal like dogs, cats, horses etc then there horrified.\nThe meat industry and slaughterhouses operate under enormous secrecy. The majority of people do not know how a slaughterhouse works or how animals end up in these places; this is\u00a0because the meat industry tries very hard to\u00a0hide\u00a0its routine procedures. No school would take children on\u00a0a field trip to one of these inhumane places. In order to get consumers to buy their products, the meat industry has to keep the horrors that millions of animals face every day hidden from our eyes and ears.\nBelow are some of the most common slaughterhouse procedures,\n1. Forced fasting, They stop feeding animals 48 hours before being sent to slaughter so there are no traces in their digestive system that impede the processing of the meat. 2. Inhumane transportation, Animals are sent to slaughter crammed into trucks that can travel long distances while banned from\u00a0food and\u00a0water. For some animals, this will be the first and the last time they see the sunshine, because they lived their entire lives inside artificially illuminated factory farms. 3. Waiting for the end Animals have to wait their turn at the slaughterhouse. The wait can last\u00a0one or two days long. Some animals, such as pigs and cows,\u00a0witness how their peers are sent to death, and suffer terribly knowing that they will be next. 4. Electrocution Before dying, different types of mechanisms are used to knock out animals before being slaughtered. Pigs are left unconscious; they are electrocuted with an apparatus\u00a0applied\u00a0to\u00a0their temples. Hens and chickens are forced to pass upside down by electrified water. And cows have their skulls drilled with a special gun, which introduces a retractable bullet into their brains. 5. Cruel death, Decapitation occurs when the animals are hung upside down. Hanging upside down\u00a0allows them to\u00a0bleed out quicker, meaning that it is more\u00a0commercially beneficial for subsequent processing of the meat. Slaughterhouses \"process\" many animals a day, so its operation is similar to an assembly line. Cows and pigs, animals of great weight are lifted from the floor by their rear legs, causing them tears and breaks. After that, they are slaughtered by the killers, their trembling bodies\u00a0can be extended endless minutes. Chickens and hens are hung upside down on\u00a0conveyor belts. They are mechanically slaughtered by machines. In poultry slaughterhouses, almost everything is automated. They can kill more than 50,000 animals in just one\u00a0week. If there is one thing I want people to do while looking at my artwork is to 'think' about what they are doing when buying or eating meat. And to please take the time to watch the video 'from farm to fridge' here\u00a0www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiFXlNkdRMc\u00a0. As the amount of suffering that millions of animals go through on a daily basis for human consumption, in my opinion is one of the worst acts of evil.\nLoading...\nView All\nAdd to Favourites\ndeviantID\nPen-Tacular-Artist\nRaj\nArtist | Hobbyist | Design & Interfaces\nUnited Kingdom\nBefore i give my life story i just wanted to highligtht that my drawings will mainly consist of graphite. And will encompass a wide variety of different 'fanart' especially sci-fi, games and comic book characters,aAs well as traditioal portraits (which is not my strong point yet). Now for my life story. I have been drawing and loved art for as long as i can remember and graduated with a degree in 'Product Design' 13 years ago. And I also had my comics strip published in a national U.K newspaper when i was only 15. But for reasons that are way to complicated to go into here, i abruptly stopped drawing. And all self belief and confidence in my drawing abilties vanished which left me having no interest in art or design and I subsequently did not draw for a full 11 years. But in mid 2012 i had an urge to draw again so opicked up my bic biro pen and haven't really stopped. And I loved using all types of pen's (hence my name) to draw, with my favourite pens originally being 'bic pens', 'magic markers' and 'rotring isograph pens'. But haveing started using graphite in sept 2012, it has now overtaken them and has now become my favourite medium to use. I am only now at a point (since my spiderman drawing) where i should have been, due to neglecting my skills for 11 years. But i am making up for lost time and drawing every day and will not be happy till my work is up to the standard of some other incredible artists on DA, like 'Angelstorm-82' . So to all the other amazing artist on here thanks for the inspiration that you give me.\nInterests\nFavorite movies The dark knight Favorite TV shows Sherlock, breaking bad Favorite games The last of us Favorite gaming platform ps3 Tools of the Trade graphite and charcoal\nComments\nAdd a Comment:\nPreview \u00a0 Submit Comment\nLoad All Images\nyololifeart Featured By Owner Mar 11, 2017 \u00a0Hobbyist Traditional Artist\nYour work is amazing!\nReply\napardesi Featured By Owner Nov 18, 2016\nCan't wait to commission a piece!\nReply\nc55m Featured By Owner Oct 8, 2016 \u00a0Hobbyist General Artist\nNever stop drawing and creating.

They retrofitted an old St. Louis fire truck with their SAM (Scene Apparatus Manager) automated fire pump system to open and close valves, set the pressure for the pressure governor, select intakes for water supply, and alert the crew if there are any problems. It allows the truck operator to focus on the crew, their safety, and instantly set or reallocate pressure where and how it's needed. The truck itself has a panel PC, the operator uses a MobileDemand xTablet T8650 rugged tablet PC with Phantom Controls SAM software. The system will be demonstrated at FDIC 2017, April 24-29 in Indianapolis.

But sometimes it's not good and accurate enough. That's where sub-meter accuracy comes in. In a recent Juniper Systems blog post, John Florio discusses their Geode sub-meter GPS receiver, a powerful, easy-to-use, and affordable GPS solution that works with Windows, Windows Mobile and Android devices.

If you do want to write a C++ game, then the source code onGithub might be handy as a referenceto see how a game can be put together quite quickly using SFML. But since itwas put together on a pretty tight schedule and not much sleep, it might belacking in comments or quality\u2026 (no known bugs though!) AndroidSince SFML supports Android development now, I figured I\u2019d have a go at portingthe game to Android. All was well until it game to adding Google Play,by which point it was becoming far more trouble than it was worth! (It neededaccess to the underlying activity which at the time of development, SFML didn\u2019tgive)Instead, I just rewrote the entire game in Java, and after a rename toSquiro (turns out calling a game something as generic as \u2018Squares\u2019 is terriblefor marketing purposes, who knew?) released my first Android app!\nDownload from Google Play\nRPG Tutorial and Libraries\nNov 16, 2015\nby Daniel Mansfield\nA few people emailed me after encountering some trouble when installing the JsonBox library required to complete the RPG tutorial, due to CMake not producing files compatible with their IDE.It\u2019s possible to complete the tutorial without using the library file explicitly by including the source code for JsonBox directly in your project and then compiling the entire thing. This makes compilation times a little slower, but it\u2019s a much easier method if you\u2019re having difficulties with installing the library. More details are in the tutorial itself.Hopefully that clears things up!\nNew Website!\nSep 21, 2015\nby Daniel Mansfield\nOld site is available at old.penguinprogrammer.co.uk Links are broken I\u2019m afraid, so you\u2019ll have to add old. in front of the domain each time. I\u2019m very sorry!Hi everybody! Welcome to the new Penguin Programmer website which I\u2019ve been working on for quite some time now. I\u2019ve moved away from Wordpress and migrated to Jekyll, an absolutely wonderful static site generator written in Ruby. The old site didn\u2019t use the dynamic aspect of Wordpress very much because I barely posted, so in the end it just acted like a giant weight slowing the rest of the site down and turning it into a fat, bloated mess of code. Now though, with an universal markup format (markdown) and much much easier customisation, performance and usability should be much improved!General performance has doubled I think, so no more long page loads (and it\u2019ll get even better when I figure out how to stop uncss from butchering my javascript), and I\u2019ve restructured the site to make everything more consistent. This means that it\u2019s easier for me to add content, and hopefully easier for you to view it!The TutorialsThat\u2019s enough about the site, but the tutorials have received a major upgrade too! I\u2019ve completely rewritten the Beginner\u2019s Tutorial and RPG Tutorial from scratch and they\u2019re much better this time. The Beginner\u2019s Tutorial covers more content and proceeds a little bit faster than the old tutorial, but it\u2019s been reordered to be less jumpy and more C++ rather than C focused. I\u2019ve also added an exercise to the bottom of each section. These are designed to be doable at the stage you are in the tutorial, and have example solutions so that you can check how you\u2019re doing. They might be a little mathematics-heavy, but that\u2019s the easiest way to keep them small!The RPG tutorial has also been mostly rewritten in order to be much more extensible and easy to design content for. Specifically, I\u2019ve introduced the use of JSON files to store the content, so no more hand-programmed game! The basic game engine is written in C++, with the JSON file defining the game world and the story. This doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s more complicated though, and again by reordering the components I think I\u2019ve actually made it more understandable than before. Overall it now resembles one of my other projects, Crawler, which is a text-based RPG engine (albeit a more advanced one) written in Ruby that uses the same (or very similar) JSON format for storing its game data.The tutorial on Data Structures has been preserved, and will be updated as I continue to develop the site. I\u2019ve removed the hangman tutorial (apologies to the very small handful of people that actually read that) and some of the other small articles that barely anyone read, and am now consolidating things into an \u201cIntros\u201d subsection which covers material too small to be made into another proper tutorial but is still handy to read.The Old SiteThe nature of the tutorials on this site means that I\u2019ve no doubt interrupted a bunch of people in the middle of the tutorials, and suddenly changed all the content so that they can\u2019t continue. Because of this I\u2019m keeping the old site available for a bit (maybe a week or so) before taking it down, it\u2019s available at old.penguinprogrammer.co.uk and is exactly the same site as before. So if you\u2019re in the middle of a tutorial, finish up there and come on over here where everything is a bit more modern and fresh!\n\u2190 Older\nNewer \u2192 Subscribe via RSSCheck out my Github", "mostFrequentWord": "tutorial", "topic4": 1, "topImportantWord": "TODO!!!!", "id": 618, "topic12": 1}, {"lang": "en", "topic8": 6, "topic2": 1, "url": "http://penguinworld.com", "text": "PenguinWorld\nHome/\nHomeTypes of PenguinIndex of SpeciesMapAptenodytesEudyptesEudyptulaMegadyptesPygoscelisSpheniscusAdelieAfricanChinstrapEmperorErect-crestedFiordlandGalapagosGentooHumboldtKingLittleMacaroniMagellanicRockhopperRoyalSnaresYellow-eyedFeaturesIndex of Feature ArticlesNest ReliefSuperlative PenguinThermoregulationPenguin ProstitutionProf PenguinFrequently Asked QuestionsContact Prof PenguinAbout PenguinWorldAbout UsLloyd Spencer DavisStoreSite Map\nSuper New Deal!\nLloyd Spencer Davis' award-winning book The Plight of the Penguin is now only $0.99c.

Most authorities suggest between 16 to 19 species, with the 17 types of penguins listed on this website being the most common. However, even one of those is in doubt: the evidence indicates that the Royal penguin is really probably only a white-faced variant of the Macaroni penguin. Yet, there might still be 17 species of penguins \u2013 or even more: genetic and other evidence is accumulating to suggest that the penguins with the long crests known as Rockhopper penguins probably comprise two, or even three, different species. Similarly, Gentoo penguins may well consist of more than one species.Each species belongs to a larger grouping of closely related species known as a genus. The living penguins comprise six genera (the plural of genus). You can see which species belong to each genus by looking under Types of Penguin in the Menu.

Read More\u2026\nIntroduction to PenguinsPenguins are flightless aquatic birds living mostly in the southern hemisphere of the Earth, except for a single species which lives near the Equator.Some experts have argued about their classification as birds due to their inability to fly and having stiff flippers instead of soft and flexible wings. However, most scientists believe that those are not the only reason to consider an animal as a bird; features like a beak, plumage or laying eggs and some other anatomical characteristics are determinant to classify them as birds.Nevertheless, penguins are the only family of water birds that cannot fly; most believe that this was part of a natural process of evolution and adaptation to a habitat where there was no need to migrate long distances or flee from many predators. Instead, they evolved to have an improved anatomical design to be agile underwater and regulate their body temperature according to weather conditions of their habitat.Penguin fossils dating back about 60 million years show that they were much larger and heavier than most modern penguins whose descendants date back to three million years ago.This family of birds was discovered by the Western civilization in the late fifteen century when sailors of the northern hemisphere found on the Argentine coast, a group of birds that were black and white. These birds were very similar to the now extinct Giant Alca also called Great Penguin (Pinguinus impennis), a bird who lived in the waters of the North Atlantic Ocean, so in consequence, they decided to name them \u201cPenguins.\u201d\nThe number of recognized species is controversial. For most scientists, there are 17 types of penguin divided into six genera, but some others classify some species as subspecies or just group them in a different way according to their geographical location.Aptenodytes forsteri, the Emperor penguin, is the largest of all species of penguins, with a height of up to 4 feet; and the Eudyptula minor, the little penguin, is currently the smallest with a maximum height of 1.25 feet. Fossils of primitive species like the Anthropornis genus, which lived millions years ago, have proved that they reached up to 5\u20197\u2019\u2019 feet tall and weight around 200 lb., the largest ever found.\nPenguin Information, Anatomy, Feeding, Habitat, Reproduction, Conservation,Evolution, Communication, Predators and Penguin Social Structure. Penguin Facts, Emperor Penguin, King Penguin, Adelie Penguin, Humboldt Penguin\nThe penguins that inhabit icy regions have rigid waterproof feathers, fat under their skin and a layer of air that keep them thermoregulated to avoid hypothermia; additionally, they are anatomically larger to store more fat, heat, and energy. That is how they manage to submerge into cold waters or withstand the mighty polar winds of their environment.The species that inhabit warmer areas are visibly thinner, due to the lower amount of fat and plumage in their bodies, and they are smaller with less submerging capabilities compared to their Antarctic relatives.A nasal gland excretes the excessive amount of salt introduced into their bodies while they feed in the ocean eliminating the sodium chloride from their bloodstream; otherwise, they could not survive.While most penguins have the unique black and white plumage reminiscent of a tuxedo, some individuals suffer albinism (absence of melanin), and approximately one hundred thousand are isabelline, which means that they have small amounts of melanin, so instead of looking black they look lighter or very light brown.Have you ever wondered why some penguins have pink patches on their faces? While penguins are well adapted to endure cold temperatures, those living in warm environments, could overheat, but those spots without plumage help them radiate excessive heat and keep them cool.The design of their beak is another adaptation that varies in each species according to the type of food they get. Banded and crested penguins that feed mainly on fish and squid have a beak with a sharp tip in the upper jaw similar to a hook, to hold their prey better. Additionally, all 17 species of penguins have porous tongues equipped with small barbs pointing backward, which help grasp the prey better and prevent it from slipping away.Indeed, penguins are fully adapted to their habitat and its conditions, although they are birds, they possess unique and custom features that help them survive under such conditions.Penguins split into six groups according to their genus:Aptenodytes genus or large penguins\u2013 Emperor penguin\u2013 King penguinEudyptula genus or little penguins\u2013 Little Blue PenguinPygoscelis genus or brush-tailed penguins\u2013 Gentoo penguin\u2013 Chinstrap penguin\u2013 Ad\u00e9lie penguin\nSpheniscus genus or banded penguins\u2013 Humboldt penguin\u2013 Magellanic penguin\u2013 African penguin\u2013 Galapagos penguinEudyptes genus or crested penguins\u2013 Macaroni penguin\u2013 Royal penguin\u2013 Erect-crested penguin\u2013 Snares penguin\u2013 Fiordland penguin\u2013 Rockhopper penguinMegadyptes genus or Yellow-eyed penguins\u2013 Yellow-eyed penguinFeedingAll penguin species feed at sea, regardless the place where they live. Some can dive to a depth of 1,800 feet looking for food and stay underwater for more than 20 minutes. Most of the seventeen species feed on small fish, squid or krill.ReproductionPenguins spend much of their lives at sea, but they all return to the land to lay their eggs and reproduce. Except for the large species that lay only one egg per clutch, the other fifteen species lay two eggs per clutch, but in every case, the male and the female share parenting duties.Text DataAnatomyPenguins rely on their specialized feathers to resist the cold weather. Besides, they have a layer of air next to their skin, which insulates their body from the freezing temperatures and retains the heat generated by muscular activity in the body.ConservationAccording to the Red List of Threatened Species, only three species of penguins are \u201cLeast Concern,\u201d five are \u201cNear threatened,\u201d five are \u201cVulnerable, \u201d and four are \u201cEndangered.\u201dPopulationThe most abundant species of penguin is the \u201cMacaroni\u201d with an approximate population of 20 to 25 Million individuals while there are only around 1,800 Galapagos penguins left in the wild. Among all 17 species, three of them have an increasing population, three have a stable number, and the remaining 11 have a decreasing tendency.Size comparisonThe largest penguin is the Emperor penguin with an average height ranging from 44 to 48 in and the smallest is the little penguin with an average height ranging from 13 to 15 inches.Types of PenguinsThere are 17 penguin species.\nTypes of Penguins\nEmperor Penguin\t\t\t\t\t\t Aptenoydes Forstieri\nGentoo Penguin\t\t\t\t\t\t Pygoscelis papua\nMagellanic Penguin\t\t\t\t\t\t Spheniscus magellanicus\nSnares Penguin\t\t\t\t\t\t Eudyptes robustus\nYellow-Eyed Penguin\t\t\t\t\t\t Megadyptes antipodes\nKing Penguin\t\t\t\t\t\t Aptenodytes patagonicus\nGalapagos Penguin\t\t\t\t\t\t Spheniscus mendiculus\nMacaroni Penguin\t\t\t\t\t\t Eudyptes chrysolophus\nErect-Crested Penguin\t\t\t\t\t\t Eudyptes sclateri\nAdelie Penguin\t\t\t\t\t\t Pygoscelis adeliae\nHumboldt Penguin\t\t\t\t\t\t Spheniscus humboldti\nRockhopper Penguin\t\t\t\t\t\t Eudyptes chrysocome\nRoyal Penguin\t\t\t\t\t\t Eudyptes schlegeli\nChinstrap Penguin\t\t\t\t\t\t Pygoscelis antarctica\nAfrican Penguin\t\t\t\t\t\t Spheniscus demersus\nFiordland Penguin\t\t\t\t\t\t Eudyptes pachyrynchus\nLittle Blue Penguin\t\t\t\t\t\t Eudyptula minor\nTypes of Penguins\t\t\t\t\t\t You can find the most common species of penguins like the\u00a0Emperor Penguin, the\u00a0Adelie Penguin, the\u00a0King Penguin, the\u00a0Galapagos Penguin, the\u00a0Humboldt Penguin, the\u00a0Macaroni Penguin, the\u00a0Little Blue or Fairy Penguin, the\u00a0Rockhopper Penguin\u00a0and the\u00a0African Penguin.\nPenguin Information\t\t\t\t\t\t The information provided about penguins in this site, includes an explanation of the\u00a0Penguin Anatomy, followed by details about the\u00a0Penguin Reproduction\u00a0and\u00a0what do penguins eat?.

Growing up, we actually never had air conditioners, but just used fans, and were totally fine. A year or two before we moved away from Northeast Ohio, my parents installed central air conditioning in our house to increase its market value.Then we moved abroad, and again, no air conditioning.This September, we'll have been married 11 years, and we've never had \"real\" air conditioning in our house. We started off using fans when necessary, and trying to avoid using fans when those weren't necessary, to keep down our electric bills. One summer we were just so miserably hot that we bought a portable second hand air conditioner for our bedroom (we were co-sleeping at the time, so it was for the entire family). It stood up on the floor, connected to one of the windows with a pipe, and worked... sort of. During times when the fan blowing on you simply felt like a car exhaust blowing on you, this portable air conditioning unit was a welcome relief even if it didn't actually make you comfortable, but it did a terrible job of actually cooling down the room. It just made it marginally better. And we didn't have any air conditioning in the living room/dining room/kitchen. The portable unit we had was barely strong enough for our small bedroom, let alone the bigger living room/dining room/kitchen. And the children's room was built in such a way that we couldn't put any air conditioning there.So essentially, no AC in our place.In the winter, we used blow heaters and radiators and halogen heaters...Yesterday we finally bought real air conditioning units that double as heaters (I think they are called split system heat pumps). The same unit warms the place in the winter as cools it in the summer. It is supposed to be the most cost efficient way to heat your home here. When we designed the layout of our new home, we had them build it with preparations already there for the air conditioning units, so we wouldn't have a large expense to install them (places for pipes and electricity).But we spent most of the winter here without those units, since I didn't get around to ordering and installing them.Finally on a price comparison website I found some decent pricing for these AC units. One large one for the living room/dining room/kitchen, and one small one for my bedroom. The kids' room is right near the living room/dining room and should be able to be cooled or heated from the adjacent room, but if not, we may also put the portable AC unit in there. We also put an air conditioning unit in our rental unit's living room. (They brought and installed AC units from their old home into two of the bedrooms.)Read more \u00bbPosted byPenniless Parentingat5:16 PM2 comments:\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to PinterestLabels:climate control,electronics,free things,frugal strategies,keeping cool,keeping warm,kids,new home,personal,spending money,summer,technology,upcycling,winter\nFriday, April 21, 2017\nChinese Style Corn Soup Recipe- Without EggsThis past week has been a very busy one in my house, foraging so many different things, shopping a for frugal groceries, doing a lot of cooking from scratch, and even being filmed by a film student for a \"day in the life of\" documentary for her documentary making class.With this film student, I went to the market and while there, got an insane amount of produce for very little. It was 55 lbs of produce for 20 dollars, and that included some great things, like dragon fruit, baby greens, fresh basil, lots of fruit, and a whole lot of ears of corn on the cob. I'm a big fan of corn on the cob, and was so excited about them, since I rarely see them for a price I like, so I don't buy it much.Unfortunately, I didn't realize that my kids aren't big fans of corn on the cob (but enjoy it just fine off the cob), so after cooking up the lot for dinner, I had quite a bit left over.I decided to whip up a batch of Chinese restaurant style corn soup, using that corn on the cob and chicken broth (made from my free chicken frames) as the base. I looked at a few different recipes for inspiration, but most had egg in it, which I don't eat, or used canned corn and creamed corn, or just seemed rather bland, so this recipe is entirely my own. If you don't have corn on the cob to use for this recipe, I'm sure it will work just as well with frozen corn or canned corn. Instead of grating the corn, put 1 cup of corn in the food processor instead of grating the two ears.I used a large amount of ginger and black pepper to give it extra oomph, but feel free to use less ginger and leave out the pepper if you want less bold of a flavor.While I haven't tried making this vegan, I am sure it would also work fine using vegetable broth in place of the chicken broth.Chinese Style Corn Soup Recipe- Without EggsRead more \u00bbPosted byPenniless Parentingat4:25 PMNo comments:\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to PinterestLabels:asian,chinese,dairy free,egg free,extreme frugality,frugal recipe,frugal recipes,frugal shopping,frugal strategies,gluten free,kids,personal,recipe,recipes,revamped leftovers,soup,soups\nSunday, April 16, 2017\nMaking Your Own Vegetable Sprouter for Microgreens and SproutsMany people are familiar with sprouts, such as bean sprouts or alfalfa sprouts. Generally people purchase these at the grocery store, but it is quite simple to make them at home. (Though I've made mung bean sprouts many times and mine always turn out less sweet and crunchy than the store bought type, and with a bitterness missing in the store bought ones. My alfalfa sprouts come out perfectly.)In my grocery store, they also sell various microgreens, especially sunflower seed and lentil microgreens, which is like sprouts, but continued a little past the sprouting stage. Microgreens are sprouts taken to the next level. Sprouts generally are eaten when just a sprout starts coming out of a seed, before there are any leaves, and the entire thing is eaten. Microgreens are sprouts that you let continue growing further, so the sprout turns into a root and a stalk, with little leaflets on them. They are packed with nutrients, much more so than a mature plant of the same variety. They are used in many fancy restaurant style/gourmet dishes, and the fact that I can make these myself for next to nothing gives me a thrill.Read more \u00bbPosted byPenniless Parentingat4:40 PM3 comments:\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to PinterestLabels:brown thumb gardening,egg free,extreme frugality,frugal strategies,gardening,gluten free,grain free,made from scratch,paleo,produce,simple,sprouting,vegan,vegetables,vegetarian\nThursday, April 13, 2017\nSweet and Spicy Carrot Medallions Recipe- Easy, Cheap, Paleo and VeganSorry for not having posted so much lately, my husband has been on spring break from work, so we've been spending time as a family and less time on the computer and writing posts on my blog. I'm sorry about that!So, what's new with me?My husband has built so many cool things for our house- I posted about a couple of them already, have another few to show, and we're still working on some more projects. That has been really fun.Since people here are also on spring break from school, I've been taking the opportunity to teach foraging classes when people are available, and that has been great! It's so nice to open people's eyes to new types of food, and help them see the wild edible plants all around them. Yesterday in one of my classes, I had a three year old enthralled by foraging, wanting to taste everything I showed them, and his excitement with the edible plant world reminded me so much of my little daughter, Rose, also three, and also in love with picking her own wild plants to eat (under my supervision, of course, but she's getting very good at identifying them).My book is due to be released next week via the publisher, Passageway Press, on Amazon and more, and as the clock is ticking down anticipation is building. I've reviewed the final proofs and I think it's going to be really awesome, and can't wait to have a hard copy in my hands after all this time! When I saw the cover photo (not releasing it until the book is released) I was ready to squeal with excitement.I've been watching a lot of cooking shows lately and getting really inspired by the various techniques I've seen them apply, and am trying to implement them in my kitchen, so that has been fun.With all that going on, I've been alternating between cooking fancy meals, some with no recipes at all, just made up on the spot but ending up perfect, and some with recipes from this blog (like the musakhan I made the other day), and then some times I just want simple but good.This carrot recipe has been my go-to carrot recipe lately, because as simple as it is, it is also delicious. My kids and I can finish a whole batch in about one meal. We love snacking on them hot or cold. They have the perfect balance of sweet, salty, and spicy, and our family finds them very addicting. As there have been requests for me to also share my simple recipes here, I decided to share this one with you guys.Read more \u00bbPosted byPenniless Parentingat3:53 PM1 comment:\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to PinterestLabels:allergy friendly,book,dairy free,easy,egg free,extreme frugality,frugal recipes,frugal strategies,gluten free,paleo,personal,produce,recipe,recipes,simple,simple meals,vegan,vegetables\nFriday, April 7, 2017\nHomemade Pallet Spice Rack- DIY MakeoverI wrote in a previous post how many spices I use, and how the little bitty spice racks I see them selling all over doesn't hold nearly enough spices for me, and the few I've seen that seem somewhat large enough are extremely over priced.

When she went to Korea for a business trip, I have to say, I was just the slightest bit envious, since going to Korea one day is a dream of mine, in part because of my fascination with Korean cuisine. Just yesterday while grocery shopping, I met a Korean expat currently living in the city nearest me, and I got so excited about meeting her, because someone else would appreciate my love of all things Korean.\u00a0Hannah told me that while she was in Korea she got to experience a side of Korean cuisine that most tourists don't get to experience- Korean real, home cooking, not the touristy stuff or the foods geared towards restaurant clientele, but every day cooking. I asked Hannah to write up about her experience as a guest post, because it sounded fascinating..A few weeks ago I had a business trip to Seoul, South Korea. I was excited about the prospect of traveling to a part of the world I had never been to before, meeting new people and seeing new places, but I wasn't too excited about the food. I know Korean food is supposed to be amazing, and I have seen many Korean recipes here on Penny's blog, but I didn't think I'd be able to try much for myself because of my strict dietary requirements. Oh well, I thought, I can enjoy travel even without the food. \u00a0The first day, everything went as planned. Together with friends we went to a food market, the food looked amazing, and I found a stand that sold roasted sweet potatoes- but a different variety than the one I know. I enjoyed the treat, even having two.But as the days went on my frustration mounted. Finally, on the day before last, I asked a friend of a friend who is Korean-American, living currently in Seoul, if she knew of anyone who could give me a private vegetarian cooking class. She immediately invited me to spend the evening with herself and her parents, and promised me a cooking class with her mom, using only ingredients I could eat. So I set out in the subway from the center of the city to a quiet suburb, as many people in this huge city of 20 million do every day.Read more \u00bbPosted byPenniless Parentingat8:54 AM4 comments:\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to PinterestLabels:asian,dairy free,frugal fun,frugal recipes,fun things,guest post,recipes,traveling,trips,vegetarian\nTuesday, April 4, 2017\nOur New Upcycled Guest Bed -- Completely Free and Very Easy!When we were first married we lived in a two bedroom apartment, one room for us and one for guests. Then we had our first child and while he started off in our room, by a certain point he ended up getting the second bedroom, and we lost our guest bedroom.When we moved to our smaller apartment nearly 6 years ago, we still had two bedrooms, but one was teeny tiny, and it got filled with two children, my two boys, while my daughters slept in our room.I enjoy having guests, and one of the hardest things for me about our extra small space was our inability to host anyone - at first we didn't even have a couch in our very small living room/dining room/kitchen.We managed to find a couch that fit our extra small dimensions and bought an Ikea Solsta couch that opened up into a bed! We could have guests at last, even if it meant them sleeping in our living room. Only the bed that opened up was extremely uncomfortable- two thirds of it was padded but the last third was just wood covered in fabric, not something I'd offer to a guest. We had children over (nephew and niece) who were short enough to fit on the soft 2/3 of the couch bed, but no sleep over adult guests.One of the things that excited me most about our new and much more spacious house was that it had three bedrooms, one which became my office, but also is intended to double as a guest room. However. while I wanted a guest room for so long, with so many expenses involved in moving and setting up a bigger household and all the new furniture we needed, a guest bedroom just wasn't a priority from a financial perspective. And so, despite our larger home, we still didn't have accommodations for guests.We do have a spare mattress that was fitting under the triple bunk bed in my kids room, for when my daughters want to sleep in separate beds, and when my little sister Lizzy asked to spend the weekend, I set up that mattress in the guest bedroom, which was OK to sleep on, but honestly, wasn't the nicest accommodations so I wouldn't feel comfortable inviting anyone else to sleep over with the room looking like that.Read more \u00bbPosted byPenniless Parentingat6:01 PM4 comments:\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to PinterestLabels:bedroom,building,crafts,dumpster diving,extreme frugality,free things,furniture,guests,husband,new home,projects,upcycling\nMonday, April 3, 2017\nHomemade Pallet Trash CanMy husband loves building out of pallet wood. I've already shown a couple of\u00a0projects my husband made out of pallet wood (sometimes with my help, but more often than not without). He likes building out of pallet wood because it's free, easy to find, and you end up with a nice rustic look, of which my husband is fond.Quite a few times in the past I came home and found my husband with a ready made project built from pallets, waiting for me.The other day, I came home from teaching a foraging class and saw my husband's latest project- a trash can, or as my South African husband would say, rubbish bin, made from pallet wood. I hadn't known this, but for a long time our garbage can was irritating my husband, as he finds the standard plastic one to be quite ugly, and not space efficient at all. The fact that trash cans are generally either round or trapezoidal makes them leave empty space at the sides, so you can fill up the trash bags less and need to take the garbage out more often.The covers for most garbage cans tend to be swinging ones, which often get dirtied when you throw in the trash, since even once you pick them up they swing back into place. And at least with our previous one, the hole in which you need to place the garage sometimes isn't big enough, which meant that often when trying to empty the dust pan into the trash can, it didn't fit, and some stuff spilled out onto the floor.And so, this pallet trash can.Read more \u00bbPosted byPenniless Parentingat1:29 PM1 comment:\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to PinterestLabels:building,crafts,decorating,DIY,dumpster diving,extreme frugality,free things,frugal strategies,husband,new home,pallets,projects,upcycling\nFriday, March 31, 2017\nForaging Wild Swiss Chard or Sea Beet in my Backyard!I love Swiss chard but it's not so cheap to buy locally. I mean it's not a fortune but it's more than I'd like to pay for a leafy green. In my home growing up we grew Swiss chard in our garden and enjoyed it. When married and in our first home, the one with a garden and chickens, my mom gave me some Swiss chard to transplant into my yard and it grew wonderfully giving us a regular supply of yummy greens. But then we moved and the Swiss chard was no more as we has no yard.Image my excitement when I found out that there is a wild Swiss chard relative, the ancestor of beets and chard, called sea beet, growing locally! It pretty much looks identical to store bought Swiss chard, only growing in the wild. Though native to the coasts of Europe, Northern Africa, and Southern Asia, it now grows in many other parts of the world. It's scientific name, beta vulgaris maritima, meaning common beet sea references the fact that it's originally a coastal plant.Unfortunately though, while it grows in other parts of my country in large quantities, in my city, I guess because we're not near the sea, I've only ever seen it in two different places. One of those places is near my husband's work, in the part of the\u00a0 city that is nearest to my town... and that same plant has been growing there for years. But just one plant. I would go back and pick some and then come another time to pick some more. But that was the only place I could forage it. I wouldn't even tell anyone about that plant because I was afraid that\u00a0 someone else would get there first and there's be nothing for me... I thought of it as 'my Swiss chard plant'.

But as people said when I shared my fried banana post, even if its not something complicated, it may be something that others wouldn't have thought to do, so why not share?Last night I wanted to make a Korean style dinner, because I had leftover Korean cucumber salad, and ready fermented wild mustard, carrot, and fennel kimchi (which came out awesomely, by the way), and a bunch of wild salsify greens that I wanted to cook up. I figured that to go with the theme, I'd make them Korean style (recipe/method to come soon).For lunch I had been super lazy and just threw a batch of chicken wings into the oven to roast, not even salting or spicing it whatsoever, just 100% plain. Recently I'd read about a scallion oil garnish that sounded good, so I threw together my own batch and topped the plain chicken wings with that. It was divine, and completed the Korean theme!Or so I thought...Because when I tried to go back and find that recipe on Maangchi.com, my go to source for delicious Korean recipes, I couldn't find it. And then remembered that I had originally seen it on VietWorldKitchen.com, My chicken wings were Vietnamese then, not Korean. Though, cooking Korean foods a lot, and being familiar with their various commonly used ingredients and many of their recipes, I wouldn't be surprised to find scallion oil in a Korean kitchen, albeit with a different name than Mo Hanh.Mo Hanh might have specific recipes in some places, but this is more a general idea than an exact recipe, because proportions don't matter so much.Read more \u00bbPosted byPenniless Parentingat10:50 AM2 comments:\nEmail ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to PinterestLabels:asian,condiments,dairy free,easy,egg free,extreme frugality,foraged,foraging,frugal recipes,frugal strategies,gardening,gluten free,grain free,made from scratch,paleo,recipes,sauces,vegan,vegetarian,wild edibles\nOlder PostsHomeSubscribe to:Posts (Atom)Pin ItShare This!\u2014end>!\u2014begin>Can't Find a Post?

But, if I had to narrow it down to the items I wear the most this time of year, here's what I would suggest investing in:Statement Earrings\u00a0(more tassel earrings) // Studded Hoops // Crescent NecklaceDainty Ring Set (more stacking rings) // \u00a0Statement Ring // Ear JacketsBeaded Bracelets // Knot Cuff // Pendant Necklace // Layered Necklace\u00a0(silver option here)SHARE VIAFACEBOOK \u2022 TWITTER \u2022 PINTERESTNo comments\n:\nMonday, April 24, 2017\nBasics PleaseAs a fashion blogger, I often feel like I'm doing something wrong if I feature a look that doesn't involve mixed prints or current trends or some type of creative layering. \u00a0Working in this industry can be challenging at times because so much of it is built on showcasing the latest & greatest. \u00a0While I do enjoy & appreciate all of those things, the truth is that for my everyday life, I really value easy basics that are wearable & comfortable. \u00a0There may not be anything groundbreaking about these pieces, but they are the ones I know I will reach for over and over again & won't be \"out of style\" in another year.This cargo skirt is one I've worn a ton (see previous looks here & here) - I love day skirts like this that have an elastic waist, don't wrinkle too easily & are easy to move around in. \u00a0A lightweight cardigan is another one of my must-have spring staples - for this time of year, I prefer to find one that has a slightly open-knit and slub texture to it - the back detail on this one is great (and it's under $20!). \u00a0I've been searching for the perfect crepe cami for a while and many of the ones I tried were either too loose, too low-cut or too sheer. \u00a0I had almost given up...but then I received this one from Everlane. \u00a0It's 100% silk & double lined so there's no risk of it being overly revealing - I also found it to be the perfect cut (not too boxy & just the right length). \u00a0Here are a few more ways I'd style it:* Tuck into a wrap skirt & pair with ankle-strap heels* Layer under a denim jacket\u00a0& pair with eyelet shorts & Sam Edelman flat sandals* Wear under a tweed jacket with crop trousers & block heel pumps* Tuck into wide leg pants with wedges* Wear under a suede moto jacket with white denim & Sperry sneakersWhat I'm wearing:One Hart Cardigan (also in black), c/o Everlane Cami\u00a0(wearing size 2),\u00a0LOFT Skirt (similar here or here; love this one too), c/o Tommy Hilfiger Sandals,\u00a0Kimchi Blue Bag (similar),\u00a0Anthropologie Necklace (similar here or here)ASOS Earrings (similar), Lips: NudeStix MysticSHOP DAY SKIRTS\nCreated in partnership with EverlaneSHARE VIAFACEBOOK \u2022 TWITTER \u2022 PINTERESTNo comments\n:\nSaturday, April 22, 2017\nWeekly Top FindsThere are lots of great sales happening this weekend, so we've rounded up our top picks & highlighted the best deals for you below. \u00a0This is the perfect time to stock up on those pieces you've been eyeing & waiting to go on sale. \u00a0Happy shopping!Ann Taylor - 40% off select full-price styles & an extra 40% off sale styles (this scalloped sweater & these tasseled sandals are calling my name)Anthropologie - extra 40% off sale styles (loving this twist tee\u00a0- also, how gorgeous is this blush dress?!)Macy's - Extra 20% off your any purchase with code WOW or $10 off when you spend $25 or more with code WOW25\u00a0+ free shipping at $49J.

These timeless staples typically have an extremely low cost per wear & can stretch even the most minimalist wardrobe to great lengths. \u00a0I've done previous posts with this theme (see one example here) & many of you have mentioned how helpful this is for coming up with new pairing ideas for items in your closet. \u00a0 So, my goal is to incorporate more of this type of content throughout the spring & summer months. \u00a0Today I'm focusing on a classic white skirt - I chose to highlight\u00a0this one because it has a slight a-line shape (which means it will flatter most figures) and it has pretty lace detailing that make it the perfect elevated basic. \u00a0It comes in 4 different colors & is currently 40% off with code FORME. \u00a0I'm showing you 6 ways to wear this versatile style & I'd love to hear which one is your favorite!

It was only when I was on vacation with limited access and resorted to exchanging long emails with a friend who was similarly inclined that I realized that what I wanted was penpals. 45 years ago I had them but I had forgotten about the whole things. The social networking apps that are really fronts for dating apps are a poor substitute for PPW.Max from ItalyThis is hands down the best pen pal site I've been to. There's something about the format that is ideal for fostering a different experience here than on other sites, whether they be dating sites or pen pal sites or whatever. Maybe it's the short profile text and single profile photo. It sets up for just a quick intro and encourages people to take a leap toward setting up their own communication. It must also be the type of users brought here. I don't know what it is, but thank you and please don't ever transition to become like interpals or some other site, because this place is uniqueScott from the USAJust a quick note to say thank you so much for having created this site. If it wasn't for you, then I would never have met what I am hoping will turn out to be my best friend forever. I will certainly promote your site to everyone, whether they want to know or not!!

It essentially provides all the security tools as a software package and lets you run them natively on Windows. This effectively eliminates the requirement of virtual machines or dualboot environments on windows. It was created because more than 50% of penetration testing distribution users use virtual machines to run those distributions on the Windows operating system.[ Source]\nFeatures\ninsert_emoticon Easy to Use It is a simple command line utility.\ngroup Simple Design The traditional green on black terminal comes with a modern twist.\nflash_on Performance PentestBox runs directly on host machines instead of relying on virtual machines, bringing obvious upgrades in performance.\nbuild No Dependencies Required All the dependencies required by tools are inside PentestBox, so you can even run PentestBox on freshly installed windows without any hassle.\nusb Portable PentestBox is entirely portable, so now you can carry your own Penetration Testing Environment on a USB stick. It will take care of all dependencies and configuration required to run tools.\nextension Linux Utilities PentestBox contains nearly all linux utilities like bash, cat, chmod, curl, git, gzip, ls, mv, ps, ssh, sh, uname and others. It even contains your favourite text editor \"vim\". For complete list, please look at tools.pentestbox.org/#linux-utilities.\nsettings No Drivers Issue Windows already has a large support of drivers for graphics cards and wireless systems, so now you wont have to worry about driver compatibility issues. For example- now you could use your GPU power to crack hashes using project RainbowCrack, which is not compatible on an environment like Linux.\nview_module Modular In the making of PentestBox we have included only the best tools , but in that process we might have missed some tools which you might want to use. In that case you can easily install those tools using toolsmanager present inside PentestBox, it can install/update/Uninstall tools which are not already there in PentestBox.\nmemory Less Memory Usage PentestBox runs on the host machine without any need for a virtual machine. So it only need's 20 MB for launching compared to atleast 2GB of RAM need for running virtual machine distributions.\nstorage Less Disk Usage It is very light on the Disk as well, it requires less than a third of what linux pentesting distro does.\ncomputer Inbuilt Browser PentestBox contains a version of Mozilla Firefox Browser with nearly all its security addons. To know the complete list of addons, please click here.\nupdate Update Feature It contains an update feature through which you can keep your tools updated. To know more about update feature, please click here.\ndevice_hub Can be shared on Network Consider an environment where you wanted to use PentestBox on many computers at the office, lab, etc. Instead of installing PentestBox on each and every computer, you can just install it on one computer and share that folder as a drive to the other computers on the same network. To find out more about this feature, click here.\nlaptop_windows 32 Bit system supported Most users aren\u2019t concerned about 32-bit support because they normally uses 64 bit systems. But this was introduced to turn low-end systems into a Pentesting Environment. Just to give an idea, i have tested PentestBox on this $200 machine, and it ran without a hitch.\nSelect Download options from right\nThere are two variants of PentestBox, one without Metasploit and other one with Metasploit.\nAntiviruses and Firewalls needs to be switched off to install and operate the version with Metasploit.\t\t\t\tDownload any of the variant by clicking respective download button present on the right side.\t\t\t\tBy default installer extract to C:/PentestBox/, and for its proper functioning do not make any changes.\t\t\t\t\tNow refer to\ntools.pentestbox.org and\ndocs.pentestbox.org\nto know about the usage of tools.\t\t\t\t\tIf you face any problems or have any questions, please check\nfaq.pentestbox.org\nor post your issue on forum.pentestbox.org.\t\t\t\t\tConnect with us on\nFacebook\nor\nTwitter\nto get updates about PentestBox .\t\t\t\t\tFound this project interesting!

The days following the funeral are characterized by nothing, save for an incessant feeling of abandonment. Until, that is, he receives a letter from a dead man. Philip's father left before he was born, taking his reasons with him. Now, here he is, opening up the door from beyond the grave. That door leads to more questions, and those questions lead to Greenland. Philip follows the clues - they're all he has left. On leaving the final signs of human civilization behind him, in search of the location mentioned in his father's ambiguous notes, Philip wonders if he's left some part of his humanity behind as well. Soon, that will be the least of his fears. Now, Philip needs your help. He's found an inexplicable metal hatch, in the middle of a frozen wasteland. Inside, is something yet more unfathomable. Gameplay Penumbra: Overture is a first person adventure game which focuses on story, immersion and puzzles. Instead of using violence to progress the player has to use his/her wits to guide Philip on his quest to unravel the past. Played from a first person viewpoint, Penumbra is very different from other adventure games. Not only is it powered by a 3D engine utilising cutting edge technology, it also has an advanced physics system which allow for a never before seen environment interaction. The player can open drawers, pull levers, pick up objects and more using natural mouse movements creating a highly interactive and immersive game world. The weapon system differs from your average game; swinging a melee weapon is done using the mouse which increases the realistic feel of combat. Fighting enemies is not something best done with brute force though, in most situations fighting is a last resort and the player is often better of using his/her wits. The AI of the enemies will also do its best to hunt and scare the player. The creatures encountered can break down doors, use group co-ordination, interact with the physics and more. Penumbra: Overture will keep players on the edge as they have to explore scary and immersive environments never knowing what is behind the next corner. The world is detailed, graphical as well as a story wise making the player feel part of the world as secrets are uncovered.\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

The giant planet Jupiter rises in the east as the Sun sets in the west, becoming our new evening \"star\". The great ringed planet Saturn rises in the east after midnight, and the red planet Mars is lost in the glare of the Sun.ORRERY(where the planets are right now)Courtesy of John WalkerSun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.From the Winter Solstice to the Spring Equinox\"Solstice\" is Latin for the standing still of the Sun. It is the moment in Earth's orbit around the Sun when the north or south pole is leaning as far as it can towards the Sun. In one hemisphere it is the longest day of the year, and in the other hemisphere it is the shortest day of the year. It is the moment when the Sun appears to stop its north/south migration in the sky and \"stand still\" - just for a moment - before it starts moving back in the opposite direction again. It happens twice a year, and traditionally marks the first day of winter and the first day of summer. In between the solstices are the equinoxes, when days and nights are equal all over the world. This year's spring equinox arrived at 4:29 AM CST, Monday, March 20, 2017, and the days continue to grow longer (in the northern hemisphere) as we move toward the summer solstice at 11:24 PM CDT, Tuesday, June 20, 2017.Venus and the Crescent MoonSanta Elena, Oaxaca, Mexico - November 27, 2011Moonrise Over a Poro Poro TreeSanta Elena, Oaxaca, Mexico - January 15, 2011Writing by RJKMusic by RJKOceanside Estate in Mexico For SaleSOLAR SYSTEMCONSTELLATIONS", "mostFrequentWord": "sun", "topic4": 1, "topImportantWord": "TODO!!!!", "id": 686, "topic12": 1}, {"lang": "en", "topic8": 4, "topic2": 1, "url": "http://www.peopleschoice.com/pca/", "text": "Skip to content\nThis site requires javascript.\nHome News\nMovies Music TV Style Celebrity Headlines\nPolls Vote Nominees/Winners\nPhotos\n2017 Photos 2016 Photos 2015 Photos 2014 Photos 2013 Photos 2012 Photos 2011 Photos 2010 Photos Archive\nHome News\nMovies Music TV Style Celebrity Headlines\nPolls Vote Nominees/Winners\nPhotos\n2017 Photos 2016 Photos 2015 Photos 2014 Photos 2013 Photos 2012 Photos 2011 Photos 2010 Photos Archive\nVideos\n2017 Highlights\n2017 Press Conference 2016 Highlights\n2016 Press Conference 2015 Highlights\n2015 Press Conference 2014 Highlights\n2014 Red Carpet\nSTYLE - #FASHIONFOMO\nLogin|Become a Member\nApr 24, 2017\ntv Reese Witherspoon And Nicole Kidman Are Not Giving Up On Their \u2018Big Little Lies\u2019 Season 2 Dreams \u00a0 You\u2019re not the only one who can\u2019t get enough of Big Little Lies.

PePiPoo grew out of an ordinary, everyday event - on a Sunday morning in April 2000 a car driver was stopped for speeding on a British motorway. It was the experience of that driver over the following nine months, as the judicial process ground along with little apparent regard for facts or rights, that built the conviction that motorists should know how the law actually works when it comes to speeding and other motoring-related allegations. In this site we aim to show you how the system works, and what you can do to defend yourself and obtain a just result. Important Notice PePiPoo do not condone breaking the law. We simply believe that motorists have the right to be treated fairly, in accordance with normal legal principles and with respect for their rights, and that allegations of motoring offences, such as speeding, should not be treated simply as an administrative issue leading efficiently and inevitably to a conviction.\nECHR \"Right to Silence\" Verdict The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has rejected the combined appeals of Gerard O'Halloran and Idris Francis against the United Kingdom by a majority of 15 to 2. This verdict enables the British Government's to continue to force motorists to incriminate themselves using S172 of the Road Traffic Act, which is almost always the only evidence of the driver's identity in speed camera cases - a denial of the right to silence that applies if you are charged with almost any other criminal offence. In both of the cases appealed to the ECHR, as in hundreds of others every day in the UK, S172 was used or threatened in order to force a confession:\nMr\u00a0O'Halloran was compelled to name himself as the driver of a\ncar at the time of an alleged offence under threat of criminal sanction under S172, and that was used to convict him of the criminal offence of speeding. Mr\u00a0Francis refused to incriminate himself and sent a letter to the police to the effect that he was asserting his rights under Article\u00a06.1 of the European Convention on Human Rights. He was convicted of failing to provide the driver's details.\nFor the latest details of the case and up-to-the-minute analysis of the ECHR decision and its implications visit our forums.\nInformation presented within this website (\"Information\") is provided solely for information and education purposes.

Go to www.perana.com.\nPerana.org is an historic car enthusiasts' site about the history of the range of Perana high performance cars\ndeveloped and produced by Basil Green Motors in Johannesburg, South Africa. The Perana cars were based on the Ford Cortina, Ford Capri, Ford Escort, Ford Granada and Ford Sapphire.\nIn each model (except the Escort XR3 and Sapphire) Basil Green used a larger capacity, more powerful engine instead of the standard unit.\nIn addition to the engine upgrades, other changes were made to suspension and brakes. On the earlier Peranas the mechanical changes were complimented by distinctive paint and striping, and on some models a selection of optional accessories. There were also a number of famous Perana racing saloon cars, including the Capri Peranas that won the saloon car championships in 1970 and 1971. Basil Green used the name Perana from 1968 onwards starting with the Cortina Perana V6.\nThis was followed by the Capri Perana V6, Capri Perana V8,\nEscort Perana, Cortina Mk3 Perana V6, Granada Perana V8, Escort XR3 Perana and finally the\nSapphire\tPerana.\nVisit our forum Our Perana Forum is a good place to meet other owners, to discuss the cars and to ask for or give advice. You can browse the forum without registering, but of course we would really like it if you register and contribute.\nThe Perana cars gained a completely justified reputation of being well engineered and properly developed cars which had a completely production look and feel without any hint of aftermarket conversion.\nCreated by\u00a0 Home Email a friend to tell them about this site.\nSearch", "mostFrequentWord": "perana", "topic4": 1, "topImportantWord": "TODO!!!!", "id": 701, "topic12": 1}, {"lang": "en", "topic8": 0, "topic2": 1, "url": "https://peppoj.net/", "text": "Skip to contentpeppoj.netThe World Will Turn If You're Ready or NotMenu and widgetsHow To: List what Procs are using the Lib in Linux Find the ProcsAfter upgrading an important package in Linux -or other Unix variant- that provides a library used by many other processes.

With strong encryption and -hopefully- a strong password.OpenSSL is generally available on all UNIX variants, downloadable as an executable for Windows and is also used with many other applications through the LibCrypto library.If you need help picking a strong password, I\u2019d recommend StrongPasswordGenerator.Com. Never share the password with the receiving party over the same medium as the file transmission. Send it Out-Of-Band over a SMS or Telephone Call or similar.In the following example, we take a file and encrypt it using AES-256-CBC, protecting it using a password and adding a salt for extra randomness. The output is added to a newly created file.~$ openssl enc -salt -aes-256-cbc -in TuxPics.tgz -out TuxPics.tgz.encenter aes-256-cbc encryption password: q55Tc9Hp68-Ry4dVerifying - enter aes-256-cbc encryption password: q55Tc9Hp68-Ry4dThe content of TuxFiles.tgz.enc is perceived as a random binary string to EVE when in transit on the open network.In the next example, we do the reverse action. Decrypting the file using the same password and appending the output to a new file.~$ openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in TuxFiles.tgz.enc > TuxFiles.tgzenter aes-256-cbc decryption password: q55Tc9Hp68-Ry4dIn case the file type is not known from the decrytion result (stdout), the \u201cfile\u201d command can be used when running Linux.Example:~$ file TuxPicsTuxPics: gzip compressed dataHave fun!Related articlesWhat is Encryption and How Can it Protect You?What is encryption, how does it work and what apps use it?Home Secretary Amber Rudd calls WhatsApp encryption \u2018totally unacceptable\u2019Posted on April 17, 2017April 20, 2017Author adminCategories Linux, TutorialsTags aes-256, Decryption, Encryption, End-to-end encryption, Linux, OpenSSL, password, secret, Unix, WhatsApp, WindowsLeave a comment on How To: Encrypt/Decrypt File with OpenSSL How To: Run a Command Quickly on Remote Server using SSH When working in a clustered Linux environment containing two or more servers, it is not uncommon to switch back and forth between the hosts.

One of those features is sending a command string to the server and fetching the output.Assuming that you have access and privileged user on the remote server, the command works as followsExample:~$ ssh user@gamma.example.com \"netstat -tulpna|grep -i established\"user@gamma.example.com's password: *****...Output...For an even more awesome experience, consider authenticating using ssh-key\u2019s.Posted on March 9, 2017April 18, 2017Author adminCategories Linux, TutorialsTags cluster, command, Linux, remote, SSHLeave a comment on How To: Run a Command Quickly on Remote Server using SSH Tattoo \u2013 Trust No One There\u2019s always room for a classic, same artist as before.

In an ideal world, I would finish each pic in 10 seconds and move onto the next pic, and then I'd give free art, lower my prices, etc. Sadly, we don't live in this ideal world and each pic takes me time and effort to make.Please, don't ask me to draw for you for free. This is my full time job, it's what I do for a living. You don't ask to get your groceries for free from a shopkeeper you don't even know. Don't ask artists to do this for you either, it's a bit unrespectful.Thank you for your understanding, and I'm sorry if I sound cruel or mean.Current Residence: M\u00e9xicoFavourite genre of music: ALLFavourite photographer: jack nicolson ( padre?)Favourite style of art: soooo...no have idea acuarelOperating System: PC MeFavourite cartoon character: Saber..uummm sexyPersonal Quote: \"yo lo haria\"points calculator:\nwww.facebook.com/theunspekeable\nInterests\nFavorite visual artist Bruce Willis, Christopher Walken, jojojo Favorite movies el vuelo de los dragones Favorite bands / musical artists Akeboshi, ahora muchos mas!!!

It can be used to describe a portion of a whole or part of a whole. It comes from per cent which is short for per centum which means per hundred.\nThe percent sign is: %\n1 percent (1%) = 1 part per 100 = 1/100 = 0.01 \u00a0 (a portion less than a whole)\n100 percent (100%) = 100 parts per 100 = 100/100 = 1 \u00a0 (a portion equal to a whole)\n110 percent (110%) = 110 parts per 100 = 110/100 = 1.1 \u00a0 (a portion greater than a whole)\nPercentage:\nAn amount per 100 that refers to a portion of a whole (in a general way) typically without using a specific number.\nPercent vs. Percentage\nThe word percent is typically used with a number (example: 10 percent) while percentage is typically not used with a number (example: what percentage of the marbles are red?). An exception is percentage points (example: 2 percentage points).\nPercentage Calculator:\nCalculator or tool that uses the percentage formula to solve for a desired value in that formula. The percentage formula contains three variables. If any two of the variables are known, the third variable can be calculated.\nPercentage Formula:\nFormula used to solve percentage problems that relates two ratios where one of the ratios is a part or portion per 100 and the other ratio is a part or portion per a whole.\nWhere:\nA% of B is C \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0as\u00a0in:\u00a0\u00a010%\u00a0of\u00a090\u00a0is\u00a09 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 where\u00a0A=10,\u00a0B=90,\u00a0C=9\nThe percentage formula is:\nA/100 x B = C \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0as\u00a0in:\u00a0\u00a010/100\u00a0x\u00a090\u00a0=\u00a09\nRearranging: A100 =\nCB\nas\u00a0in:\n10100 =\n990\nThe percentage formula is sometimes expressed as: percent100 =\nis(part)of(whole)\nas\u00a0in:\u00a0\u00a010100\u00a0=\u00a0990\nSolving for each of the variables yields:\nA = (C / B) x 100 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0as\u00a0in:\u00a0\u00a0A\u00a0=\u00a0(9\u00a0/\u00a090)\u00a0x\u00a0100\u00a0=\u00a010\nB = C / (A / 100) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0as\u00a0in:\u00a0\u00a0B\u00a0=\u00a09\u00a0/\u00a0(10\u00a0/\u00a0100)\u00a0=\u00a090\nC = (A / 100) x B \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0as\u00a0in:\u00a0\u00a0C\u00a0=\u00a0(10\u00a0/\u00a0100)\u00a0x\u00a090\u00a0=\u00a09\nNote: A% = A/100 because % means per 100\nHow are percentages used?\nstore discounts: 25 percent off sale\nsales tax is typically a percentage of purchase price: 8% sales tax\ninterest rates for savings accounts are typically shown as an annual percentage rate (apr): 1.5% apr\ninterest rates charged by credit card companies and mortgage companies are shown as an annual percentage rate.\ninterest rate changes: interest rates rose one percentage point from 4.5% to 5.5%\nstatistics: the margin of error is plus or minus four percentage points\ncredit card rewards: 2% cash back for certain purchases\nnews: approval ratings, employment rate, and surveys can be expressed using percentages\nlaptops, tablets, and cell phones usually have a battery charge percentage indicator\nweather forecast: 20 percent chance of rain\nprobability: the chance to win a prize is 1 in 10 or 10 percent\nhumidity: the humidity level is 65%\nPercentages can be used to make the relationship between a portion and a whole easier to understand.\nAnytime you need to solve a percentage problem, the percentage calculator is here to help.\nCalculators\nwith examples:\nPercentage Calculator Percentage Calculator in common phrases Percent Calculator Add or Subtract a Percentage: Tips, Percent off, Sales price, Tax Percent Change Percent Error Percent Difference\nHow to use the percent button\non a calculator\nPercent and percentage definitions\nPercentage formula\nCalculator /\nAbout /\nPrivacy /\nContact /\nSitemap\n\u00a9 2013 PercentageCalculator.Co All rights reserved.", "mostFrequentWord": "percent", "topic4": 1, "topImportantWord": "TODO!!!!", "id": 708, "topic12": 9}, {"lang": "en", "topic8": 6, "topic2": 1, "url": "https://www.percederberg.net/", "text": "percederberg.net\nHome\n\u00bb\nAutomatic GUI Creation\n\u00bb\nBist\u00e5ndets Afrika\n\u00bb\nArgumentationanalys\n\u00bb\nVarf\u00f6r k\u00e4rnkraft?\n\u00bb\nDv\u00e4rgen\nTexts\n\u00bb\nJavaScript Interactive\n\u00bb\nRapidContext\n\u00bb\nSimple-Admin\n\u00bb\nMibble\n\u00bb\nGrammatica\nSoftware\n\u00bb\nTetris Game\n\u00bb\nSudoku Helper\nGames\n\u00bb\nDNS Lookup\n\u00bb\nText & Data Converter\n\u00bb\nCryptographic Hashes\n\u00bb\nBinary Files & Images\nTools\n\u00bb\nMe\n\u00bb\nCurriculum Vitae\nAbout\nRevolution \u2014 One Step at a TimeRevolutions don't work.

It is helpfull to answer questions like:\n1) What is ten percent (%) off $one hundred?\t\t \t\t2) How much will you pay for an item where the original price before discount is $ one hundred when discounted ten percent (%)? What is the final or sale price?\t\t \t\t3) $10 is what percent off $100?\t\t \t\tSee how to solve these questions just after the Percent-off Calculator (or Discount) below.\nhow to work out discounts - Step by Step To calculate discount it is ease by using the following equations:\nAmount Saved = Orig. Price x Discount % / 100 (a)\nSale Price = Orig. Price - Amount Saved (b)\nNow, let's solve the questions stated above: 1) What is 10 percent off $100? Find the amount of discount. Suppose you have a Kohls coupon of $100 and you want to know how much you will save for an item if the discount is 10. Solution: Replacing the given values in formula (a) we have: Amount Saved = Original Price x Discount in Percent / 100. So, Amount Saved = 100 x 10 / 100 \t\t\tAmount Saved = 1000 / 100 \t\t\tAmount Saved = $10 (answer). In other words, a 10% discount for a item with original price of $100 is equal to $10 (Amount Saved). Note that to find the amount saved, just multiply it by the percentage and divide by 100. 2) How much to pay for an item of $100 when discounted 10 percent (%)? What is item's sale price? Suppose you have a L.L. Bean coupon of $100 and you want to know the final or sale price if the discount is 10 percent. Using the formula (b) and replacing the given values: Sale Price = Original Price - Amount Saved. So, Sale Price = 100 - 10 Sale Price = $90 (answer). This means the cost of the item to you is $90. You will pay $90 for a item with original price of $100 when discounted 10%. In this example, if you buy an item at $100 with 10% discount, you will pay 100 - 10 = $90. 3) 10 is what percent off $100? Using the formula (b) and replacing given values: Amount Saved = Original Price x Discount in Percent /100. So, 10 = 100 x Discount in Percent / 100\t\t\t10 / 100 = Discount in Percent /100\t\t\t\t100 x 10 / 100 = Discount in Percent\n1000 / 100 = Discount in Percent, or Discount in Percent = 10 (answer).

A puppy or kitten comes into this world and immediately begins learning from their surroundings and every interaction they have with their littermates, a person or another animal. When we first bring home a pet a new relationship begins and the opportunities for teaching and training are boundless. Although a new adult dog or cat may have some baggage, we still have a \"first interaction\" training opportunity.Your pet's behavior is constantly changing. A pet that is well-behaved today will not necessarily remain that way forever. New problems can always develop. Existing problems can get worse. Nearly all behavior problems are perfectly normal, natural and necessary activities that occur at the wrong time or place or are directed at the wrong thing. The key to training your pet is learning to teach your pet to redirect his behaviors to outlets that are acceptable in the domestic setting. Sometimes there is no appropriate outlet so we must train our puppy, dog or cat to stop a specific behavior altogether.Regardless of age, you must decide upon guidelines for training your puppy, dog or cat and these guidelines should not change. You must be consistent and be patient so that your pet understands the difference between the behaviors you want and the ones you don't. You must give your pet a chance to get it right.Just for Fun..
